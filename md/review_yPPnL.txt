allthedew reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so this here is the glossier stretch concealer it's honestly one of my go to Everyday favorite concealer is this is actually my second two of the stuff it's obvious he will love that you can see Captain also from the inside this is already my second one is never ready it's just so nice like a light to medium coverage it gives a beautiful dewy finish under eyes which is super nice and brightening I really enjoy this I know they recently changed the name and added a lot more sheetsbut yeah I honestly highly highly recommended it's just such a great one it's not full coverage so don't expect that from from this if you honestly don't like dewy foundations and maybe this isn't for you but maybe have dry skin like myself you might enjoy this quite a bit
