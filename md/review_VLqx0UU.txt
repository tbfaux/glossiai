WakeupMakeup reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: play super great guess he's okay so now I'm going to be reviewing the glass see a private moisturizer bridge I like to use this at night because it does kind of have like a little bit of a lavender smell and as you can tell it's one of my daisies I literally literally I just I love the smell remember ladies that is one of my big things I'm pretty sure y'all are going to get to know that by now to know a lot about me is I use a lot of productI just do I don't know why there's no excuse I really really really really well just stuff it just makes my skin feel so moisturised and I just love it I really don't use it in the morning to be honest with y'all and I like to use it at night like I said you to smell but I really love it it's about $35 I believe that I truly loves it and I love you
