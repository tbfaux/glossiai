ariannaa reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: good morning guys this is a glossy lipstick I said I was going to do a review on this when I first got it and I never did because I didn't like it which I should have done a review but I never thought about it and I don't know what's that in my bag so this past weekend I went to my parents house and I completely forgot like Acne Clearing products including a toner and everything like that I don't know why I forgot it but I did and it is a week before my wedding is a huge zit there he's one there you can still kind of she some of them but it was horrible I was like oh my God what do I do so I can have this on my back and look like I hope to God this works and it's like basically gone like a splat so we can cover that up with makeup I like
