astripli reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: I'm pretty much done with my morning makeup routine but I saw that my daughter actually reviewed this and there's a couple of things she did not tell you guys my daughter's Kitty Cat by the way if you guys want to go and talk to her but this this stuff is Albom for your lips that's what she used to work so I actually got eczema on my hands and I use this for that and it is amazing for dry skin so if you got like dry elbows or you have eczema or whatever music since he bit of this stuff on it not only does it smell good but is really soothing and really suits dry skin very well
