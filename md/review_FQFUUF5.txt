mayareviews reviews Haloscope by Glossier: hey friend Slimmer reviewing glossier's haloscope highlighter in topaz so from what I know this is a super hydrating highlighter has coconut oil and this one's kind of more of a bronze Sunkissed shade so far I love it it's got that really sun kissed glow and it's subtle but still really nice and I'm a fan I've been wanting to try this highlighter for forever so I'm really excited hopefully I can show you guys some looks with it later on
