_emilymarie reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so these are four of glossier lidstar so I have it in Lily herb Moon and Cub these are my favorite eyeshadow formula of all time because they're really cool liquid but they're shimmery but also natural at the same time and they last a really long time and they're super easy to apply I just use my fingers I don't even use a brush which is ideal for me because I'm very low-maintenance and yeah so these are just like the best thing and I really want to try a couple more shade soon but I really love these can you can even mix them together wear them on top of each other and they're just really versatile and I think that they work with everyone and yeah
