kendrae reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: Play the song I know I'm a little late to the game and I know you're going to hear a little background noise I am dog sitting and she's kind of wild but these so I'm going to do like a lipstick so I'd like three more lip products to review tonight but do you starting off with a perfect way for hydration because then the next step is going to be a lipstick so I normally use this on an everyday basis just cuz there's no color but I'm currently wearing the Cherry one I think the Cherry one is my favorite one out of the three I have I have birthday cake but I currently don't know where it is but I just like this one I like the flavor most I like the consistency of most I find this one to be watery and sometimes it comes out gross so maybe it's just because it's a little cold but I'm it's not even a year yet so but if you don't have these in your collection just go get Vaseline but there's still like fun.
