katiestark reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: time to talk about glossy milky jelly one of my all-time favorite products exported a little bit on my finger it is such a interesting consistency as you can see it is gel-like it's really really soft feeling and it doesn't foam like you most Condors jail how much I'd like cuz I feel like it's on his messy I'm going to get everywhere right now and it's super hydrating conditioning I think is an accurate word I use it more as a second cleanse I don't feel like it gets all my makeup off like they suggested does and I just keep this in the shower and I use it when I shower and I love it and this is probably my like I don't know if it's bottle
