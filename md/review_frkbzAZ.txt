kimberlygisele reviews Generation G by Glossier: going to do a super quick part 2 about this product is 18 US Dollars it comes in I want to see like five different shades I do like the formulas they're not drying they sit well and these are perfect for just on the go in my bad type of days I will say though that moving forward I'm not going to be purchasing these or any of the existing glossier products that have a collection just reversing a reason I recommend if you have the opportunity to check out out of the gloss on Instagram that is kind of just like a little bit more insight on my own personal decision but of course I do still want to use this up and be mindful of eliminating waste so you will likely see some of these products still on my page here but just because you know what they've been part of my routines before I want to use them up and yes they do perform well the ones I have actually and the good thing about makeup is it's different for everybody you can like different things you can find different things and I'm excited to just keep exploring and see what I can find I do have to be smart in school
