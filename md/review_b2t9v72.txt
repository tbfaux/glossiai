mariahusken reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: I just been my hair back because it's looking a little cray cray but let's talk about the glass table. I think it's a pretty good product that's nice that I don't get too caught up in filling in and doing the shape of my route cuz often I actually don't like my eyebrows and I have shaved off like more than half of them many times as recent as a few weeks ago but there's trying to go back now so that's good it's super easy to use use it just like any other brow product of this caliber but I do think I prefer the Gimme brow by benefit
