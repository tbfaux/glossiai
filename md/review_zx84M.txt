howdoyouglow reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: this is glossier boy brow and I have it in brown this is what Lee wand looks like as you can see if it will focus it's very small and relatively large amount of product. Sometimes so usually I just swipe It Off on YouTube but I have pretty thick eyebrows I don't usually fill them in with the Pomade or a pencil or anything like that I usually just use gel and this one is for my needs it's filled in like any empty areas I might have on my eyebrows and just kind of makes them look a little darker and more filled in and this doesn't make your brows feel crunchy and it holds very well and I think this is a great product
