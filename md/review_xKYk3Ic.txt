ShafaBrokenFace reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello Rebecca. Make a list ignore my bad I make up whatever and ignore the background noise like it going I just received my adorable package Hiwassee a first thing I pulled out of the box was my samples of the cloud paint and this adorable frequency a sticker okay I got some lip cord Co here is a cute bag the three items are out you can personalize which one of each of these items you got but your name for a bum.com a lip gloss and a lipstick I got the birthday balm.com the red lip gloss and the generation sheer matte lipstick and Crush here is the bomb.com here is the lip gloss and here is the lipstick the bones most amazing so I'm applying it feels like a lip balm if I'm going to be honest I feel like a normal lip balm and it's a little overpriced I think okay next time I tried to be full of stick so this is not have a lot of coloration this is a lot of swipes in the gloss
