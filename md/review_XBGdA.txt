valeriaprada reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so now I'm reviewing the glossier boy brow on the color brown I think it's brown and I really like this product because I used to do my brows with like three products and this one does a job in just one so the way I like to use it I just brought a little bit of the exit of product and I start doing my brows at the bottom because it has a lot of product and I don't want to mess my brows up and then I go to the front and just brush them so this is the final result this was my natural brow in this the boy brow you get are really natural Brown a super the find one but I really like this look and it's so quick and easy
