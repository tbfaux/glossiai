mads_beauty reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to do a quick review on Garcia's on perfecting skin tint so this isn't a shade G9 that you can see I would say it's a little dark for my skin but it's fine because when to blend it in doesn't really young I can't really tell but I really like it just for a quick put on and go kind of thing especially if you're into that natural look it's great it's got a nice doing this obviously as it says on the container and tells you how to put it on which I like about glasses products but if you're looking for something natural and light I would say this is the go-to especially in the summer if you don't want anything looking too cakey or sick this is probably your best bet
