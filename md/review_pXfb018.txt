Lia_reviews reviews Glossier set Lip Gloss and Lash Slick by Glossier: hi and welcome back today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier clear lip gloss so unfortunately I don't have the Pack but I really wanted to view the review this lip gloss cuz it's on my favorite so this is what it looks like on its super glossy and super clear and the applicator is super soft and it's super easy it's not sticky at all and it smells like coconut I really like glossy are because it's mostly vegan and they don't test on animals so it saves a bunch of animals and yeah it is a little pricey but I definitely would recommend if you're looking for a strong long bear super glossy lip gloss so this is what it looks like over another lipstick it looks really good it's super glossy and super smooth and I would definitely recommend thank you for watching and I have to go to the glass your website and purchases
