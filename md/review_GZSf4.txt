jessjackson reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so I wanted to talk about another gloss hair product super obsessed with everything glossy a like I love anything that they put out their Cloud paint beam and it's a really pretty peachy pink you color it's basically a cream blush I apply with like a stippling brush just make sure I blend it in really good looks Supernatural it does draw down all the way and other products layer grey over it I usually put foundation or concealer on first and then I'll put on the blood I'll show you guys a Swatch hang on just a second so here's a spot on my hand as you can see really pretty peachy pink color is actually started to draw down a little bitso if you're looking for a really easy Cream Blush to work with that would suggest the cloud paint it's awesome
