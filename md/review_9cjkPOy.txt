missylissy reviews Skywash by Glossier: hey guys so here I have the glossy a sky wash which is their newest launch this is a matte eyeshadow it's so it's like a liquid to powder and I have it in the shade pool which is really pretty blue shade so I just have a little concealer no powder or anything on my eyelids I'm just going to put it directly on top this is what it looks like it's just a really easy to use diffused matte eyeshadow takes like 3 seconds to blend out this particular shade room ideas like the 90s and people would wear like a powdery blue eyeshadow I personally prefer the lid Stars cuz I feel like it just a little more Chloe and Youthful but you know it depends on your car
