lopezalessandra reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: we're going to review this product together it's bubble wrap so give me your hand Chris you can put it on your lips or under your eyes they're both the same pot with 45 seconds left non-greasy unscented I appreciate that and like she said it's not very sticky it's it's supposed to be moisturizing for your eyes and lips I can see how it can be moisturizing for the lips but I have definitely had more luxurious and thicker eye creams which I would appreciate if I were to buy an ice cream ice cream lip balm hybrid so for me it's a hit or miss and I would rather go one way or the other but this tries to do with both so I guess if you're traveling it would be good but if you have both an eye cream in a lip balm is just it. Yeah
