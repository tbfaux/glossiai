zameena reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: everybody so I've got the glossy protecting skin tint I've applied to stretch concealer switch pictures chicks up and then it's a little messy but kind of like drip it on to your skin and you can use a blender but I honestly feel that this is so late that I just gets absorbed if you use a sponge I guess you could also End Theory use a brush but then and I find that tools absorb the product and then you're left with just a little bit on your skin so anyways this is what I typically do I just use my fingers go ahead and why does make sure that's even throughout you thought I was last such a long time so
