beautybymonamarie reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: my favorite eyebrow product right now is glossy a brown flick are you sitting in the shade black shake it up I store it like this with the cap down to that all the ink stays in the tip you know but the point is very very fine so I already did my eyebrows but it lets you create the softest little hair Strokes it's very natural and once this dries and sets it does not budge like I can rub my eyebrows and like this is dry nothing does not much love it so much
