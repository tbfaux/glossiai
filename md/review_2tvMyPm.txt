ninii reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: are you guys to the next step in my little routine here cuz I'm getting some Cloud paint on my eyes my lips and my cheeks it's a monochrome if you guys haven't use cloud paint before it a little goes so long like this is plenty so I'm blending it kind of to match the outer corners of where the liner meet I dabbed A Center in lips and I'm lazy so I'm just pulling out the cheek with my fingers super cute I love how all the sudden I have a monochrome moment and when you have to make on the cheapest of my lips it really just ties everything together and adds lovely heads of color to your face
