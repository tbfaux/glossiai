Emma_mwah reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: all right today I'm going to be talking about the glossy a cloud paint now this stuff is amazing it's so cute I never really liked blush before I got this but this stuff is so cute and I have the shape of here and what I love about them is that like all of the colors work really well on a lot of different skin tones so I'm really excited to get more of these all right so what I do to put some on cuz I put a little my finger like that you just rub them in between and then powder on my cheeksit's really subtle in a really cute blush color I love it so much just makes you look all flushed and cute so for sure get this especially if your blush lover or a newfound flush lever like I was you should for sure invest in some Club pain you will not regret it at all
