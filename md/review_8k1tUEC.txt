justinealexis reviews Generation G by Glossier: this is my review of glassy H&G lipstick in the shade cake I'm wearing right now and I have three to four swipes of the product on my lip so it's pretty pigmented but one quick swipe is going to get you like a really sure wash of color the shade cake is a neutral kind of peach shade I think that it looks really great on me I like that it goes with both looks or something a little bit more natural and it's pretty moisturizing despite the fact that it is kind of marketed as a matte lipstick I also really like that it sort of has it kind of wears throughout the day looks more like a lip stain I was looking for something it was a great easy everyday lip color and this totally fits the bill for me in that regard I want to try a couple different shades of this I actually am super into it so I highly recommend it
