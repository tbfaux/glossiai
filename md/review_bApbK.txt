Beautaf reviews Blade Sharpener by Glossier: okay guys so I am unpacking the glassy blade again if you've seen my vanilla clip review you will have seen the packaging that comes with it but this again is so different from anything goes he has done up to now packaging is very different and also the box that doesn't have the pancake it usually has so I thought that was different but cute I guess because they want to be creative so here is the blade honestly this is probably the prettiest sharpener I've seen like I would I would put this in my pencil case this is very pretty and it also comes withsharpener cleaner so you remove the residue of from the blade by using the stick
