sarah_novio reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey it's literally been so long since I made a review but I want to talk about this k-beauty juicy Pang blusher and I'm going to demo it on my cheeks right now so I was kind of on the hunt for glossy a deuce that were from K Beauty Brands because someone kind of told me about that and that there's some similarities and I found this washer on yes style and it looks like nail polish and you literally just brush it on your cheeks and Blended out so these literally remind me of the cloud paint in beam and a blintz are really nicely has really good pigment so this was $8 plus $5 shipping so it actually really wasn't that bad and they usually always have sales on yesstyle so I feel like this is a really good bye
