susanna_1917 reviews Solution by Glossier: hey guys so this is the glossier solution it's a really good exfoliator for any type of skin but this is mainly used as an acne treatment so the one thing I like about this is the pump it's really cool you can just put your cotton pad on top and it's press on it and it gets on the Cotton pad really easily and but the one thing I don't like is that it smells really bad sometimes I'm cuz it's a really strong exfoliator and other than that I think it's really good for any type of skin
