zameena reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: so this is the glossier milky oil makeup remover this is honestly some of the best makeup remover I've used in my life cuz it's so gentle nourishing and super good at removing eyeliner if you've used concealer for your eyeshadow the stuff will take it off even if you've used glitter especially if you've used the glass a glitter or any glitter the stuff will take it off if you put it on a cleansing pad piece of tissue whatever you wipe your makeup off the stuff is really good at it so as you can see there's a little bit of separation between the oil and the rest of the liquidand got really soft texture and I just wish that they sold us in a bit bigger bottle
