abooogie_ reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: this is a low-class to text me back to the my lipgloss is poppin' era I mean I stopped wearing lip gloss until I found this I found Lucas annoying since I found this this is the reason why I like lip gloss again honestly because I hated her sticky lip gloss well as I hated that they didn't do anything for you they were just super sticky tacky stuff sitting on your lips and but this isn't I mean this is nourishing it's not super sticky it has amazing shineand the price point is great it's so good it's only 14 bucks so I think that if you don't like lip gloss or haven't tried one knew you should try this one out
