amandalynch reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hey guys so I am to Days Inn using the glossier milky oil to remove my makeup at night I love the packaging it is the perfect size is 100 ml are perfect for travel remove your makeup really really quickly with just a cotton pad the only thing I have to say for this personally with me is my skin did not react well so not sure if it's just in conjunction with my regular skin care routine and the asses and stuff that I use but I definitely will not be using this product anymore but if you're someone who's not as sensitive and kind of changed their routine up a lot I would say go for it cuz it's adorable but Buy Baby
