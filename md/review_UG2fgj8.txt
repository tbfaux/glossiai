kaileejai reviews Solution by Glossier: and that's why I just recently got a package from last year and one of things I was most excited it is this exfoliator it's kind of a mix between exfoliator and a toner and I just I absolutely love it and I think that was out of nose is not only advice I filled my skin feel amazing after I use it also has to do her like that and then press on it and it smells really good but we're not going to talk about that and I just don't know how it feels amazing and after I always see an improvement and how my skin looks and feels and general and I would recommend a lot it's literally one of the best things I've ever used and it's even on my face and makes it feel fresh makes it feel good I cleaned it helpsI love everything about it and I would highly recommend it plus it's really cheap and something that I'm able to afford and it shipped really quickly I only ordered a few days ago but yeah this is the glossier exfoliating
