MarinaSelmi reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hi guys I'm going to be talking about glossier skin tint so I just have really bad acne and used to use a lot of medium and High coverage Foundation but ever since my skin Buckley ricer worry more skin tint and BB cream and stuff like that so I got this product a few months ago and I really love it in my skin I'm wearing on me right now so it doesn't cover all the blemishes but it gives you a really like nice silky and dewy finish and I definitely recommend it
