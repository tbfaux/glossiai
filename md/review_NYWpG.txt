weird_bronwyn reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys so I'm just going to be reviewing the glossy a Milky jelly cleanser I bought this cleanser with the hopes that it would be a new way for me to fully remove all of my eye makeup I've had problems in the past with removing leftover mascara and I found this product was able to do the job and I was three products smells faintly of Rose it isn't terribly expensive compared to other makeup removers now on the market but it isn't within the drugstore price point so yeah but it does not like I said family Rose and two pumps of this can honestly take off the makeup all over your face I found soyou really don't have to use that much of this product to get the job done so I 10 out of 10 recommend
