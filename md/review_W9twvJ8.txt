legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: Christopher great so this is the akwasi cloud paint in the shade Dawn so I've nothing on my cheeks right now if I thought I'd show you guys as I put this on so this is a true orange blush like true there's not many that I would consider to be true but this definitely I'm going to squeeze real late cuz just a dying like this is more than enough I would never put this directly on my cheeks just because it's so hard to control how much comes out like this is way too much so I always put it on the back of my hand and then I will. The littlest bit right hereso here it is as a light wash you can definitely build this up more I want to put another blush on top of this that's why I kept it late but this is so so beautiful
