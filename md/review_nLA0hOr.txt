Airee21 reviews Glossier Cloud Paint Duo Storm and Dawn 0.33 fl oz Pack of 2 by Glossier: all right you guys no matter what I freaking do today I cannot get my camera to focus this is Dawn by glassia it's so cloudy pee and today I am teaching you how to neutralize under your eyes so if you struggle with dark circles like me mine aren't too too bad now that I've been using a clinic for a few years total game-changer to neutralize the dark circles we want to do orange under the eye so if you own a an orange lipstick that is a good one this orange black it works really well as wellyeah something like this without the shimmers would be good so I already did one layer I'm going to go in with another one and then I'm going to do some concealer under this side and show you the differentiation okay so stay tuned thanks for watching part 1
