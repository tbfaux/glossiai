mimosa reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: this is the classic glossy lip gloss that I've been obsessed with since seventh grade smells Loke delicious such a nice applicator it flexes with your lips it is not sticky this is the highest shine gloss that I have ever encountered I mean look at that shine and it just feels in every single line on your lips so it kind of even has a plump in effect sometimes I'll put it on my eyelid for a glossy eyeshadow look super hydrating and nourishing
