elizabethhhloves reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so this is the glossy stretch concealer and I have it in the shade G9 I believe this is equivalent to their original medium shade so it's basically just a very very creamy concealer in a pot the second one that I have that I have it's just the most preemie the most natural-looking concealer that I've tried that comes in a pot that is creamy and also isn't too expensive I like that this just gives your skin a really nice like natural Luminous Finishbut it doesn't slip around everywhere like a lot of other cream concealers that are also just as slippery will do I also like it for covering up any blemishes is tapping it on works perfectly it's just the perfect light to medium everyday concealer
