hannahroselund reviews Haloscope by Glossier: this is my absolute favorite highlighter ever I know I said about all of glasses product but I really do love this gives such a nice creamy holiday finish and yeah I just makes you really grow compared to that effect powder highlighters when you put it in when you can do some on your nose or on your Cupid's bow anytime I see but really nice formula and yeah I really liked it I definitely prefer cream highlighters and so this is perfect for me
