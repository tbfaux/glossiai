ariannaa reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: so this is the glossy play vanilla clip in the color blow-up now I love glossy a I love with a saying for I love everything there about however when I first ordered this I ordered it when it was a special drop I can't read all these extra coin saved up and I ordered it went the first day it was released and they mark my orders fraudulent so I just got it today and now I'm missing one of my other products not in the bag like I'm irritated at this point I do love this vanilla clip it's very cream not a sticky buildable for sure I just put on how much to see how much would go on listen to the max you can put on without it like rubbing off but I love the shine I love the little bit of Shimmer to it it's very nice other than this whole situation
