mollia716 reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: so this is the glitter jelly from glossy play I got it in the color class bonsai I'm really excited to see how this looks this is one of the products that that I was most excited to try so I use the detailer and I just watched a little of my hand this is so fun I really love this it's lots of little flecks of gold and like iridescent glitter flats and then I also put them on my I just a little bit so you can see how it really grabs the light and it just looks amazing I could totally see this wearing wearing this out one night and just like loving this I really think this is worth the money this is super unique I haven't seen anything else like this and yeah I would say go try it for different colors
