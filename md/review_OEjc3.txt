discobeautie reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: okay so I have kind of really weak baby browse as you can see on the side I have no tits relief are blondes so I use the brown in the boy brow it comes on a just a little spin. We can see that mine's really warm and I had already started on this brow but you kind of just brush it in and it's really simple to use like it's easy to kind of just manipulate compact brush a little so yeah once you have I called your makeup done it really looks really natural so that's why I like it
