clare0b reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so back in January I placed my first ever glossy order and in that order I got the cloud paint in the shade dusk and while I really enjoyed the creamy and blendable formula I wasn't so pleased with the shade that I got on the website it kind of look more like a Dusty Rose but on me it tends to look white brown and so I didn't really get as much use out of it as I hoped that I would but I've since discovered that it looks amazing as a fall blush it. Brown shade is perfect when you pair it with coppery Brown eyeshadows and I am really enjoying it now it's really easy to apply I like that I can just use my fingers and it's like one and done ready to go out the door
