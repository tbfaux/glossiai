chai reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: so I have really oily skin so I have to use a lot of acne products at night and this actually is really good to apply after because it's really moisturizing it is really a medium steak consistency and it has a slight lavender smell it works great as a night moisturizer I recommend that and by the way it does feel like a luxury moisturizer and it's not that expensive so I really really encourage you guys to try this out
