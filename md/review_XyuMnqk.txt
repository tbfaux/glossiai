harmonym reviews Generation G by Glossier: okay guys I'm vintage I'm old school and I still have the old packaging of the glossier generation G lipstick I don't know if that's a cool sign because like I'm cool I have the old packaging honestly just packaging is shity like I understand why they updated it because like I got a big crack in one but I guess it's also a sign that I don't ever really wear this which I don't know why it's really pretty flattering I have mine in the shake and I currently have it on right now as you can see like it's not that big of a difference from like my normal lip color of it has kind of like a nudie pinky orange tint to it a little bit of shine the person I'm not a big lip girl I don't really ever wear lipstick or lip color I do think this is some in this really pretty however I don't know if I would ever repurchase it I wouldn't be mad if I got it as a present but I wouldn't spend my money to get it again I know that they may have reformulated a little bit but for my personal liking who likes nudes item
