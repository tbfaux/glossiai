ariannaa reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: good morning everybody so this morning I woke up and I felt really good so I'm sure loves you do this but this is like glossy a mango bomb.com I put this on last night before I went to bed my lips feel hydrated they feel plumper they feel moisturized they're not cracked it's incredible and I recommend this product 1000% so minus cuz it's worth it it's so worth it I think that it's a little expensive but you do get a ton of product and you barely have to use any like what I put it on I just barely squeeze it then put it on
