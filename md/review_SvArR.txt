maryfox04 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so I'm here with my last bomb.com with you and this is the Rose balm and this is definitely one of my favorite ones I really love the scent I really love obviously how it feels is it feels just like all the other ones but definitely the sent is probably my favorite it's a very calming Rose it's not like a big fragrance like overwhelming smell it's really nice also I just like to point out that for these yes there are expensive but this is about how much you would use and honestly that is not a lot at all I've already put some on so this is a bit extra buttyou're not using a lot of product each time and there is a lot of product in here so I would definitely recommend these I really like them all
