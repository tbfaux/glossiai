JayciNicole reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys just wanted to quickly review this glossier balm.com for you so this is the Rose scent supposed to be a little bit tinted pink honestly I don't notice that much of a difference I don't know if it depends on your skin tone or not but it smells really good it's kind of floralie you can put it on your cuticles which actually really has helped my nails grow and be stronger so yeah that's a really good product I would definitely recommend it I've swapped out all my chopsticks for it so it's worth it classic try it out it's not my favorite since I like the mint won the most
