legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: his four grade supposed to stay glossy lip gloss and holographic so I visit winners like every other day after school cuz recently Declassified has been showing up apparently around winter finally hit gold and found a bunch of them so this is the only one of the stuff that got that I just opened but so I was actually kind of hoping that this would be more Halo but I have it on my lips and it's basically a clear gloss I'm probably one of the few people who actually wanted this to like this exact amount of Halo to be on my lips but I guess it makes sense plus glossy as a kind of like a more understated makeup brand it is still really really pretty if you get really close to or if there's like bright sunlight you can see a little bit of the Shimmer but for the most part this is a really nice clear gloss is super super sick and hydrating it but it's not sticky or anything like that yet just feels really nice and I really like it
