tru_beauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: he isn't going to be reviewing glossier's ever famous Cloud paint I have the colors Don and Dean and as you can tell someone is very very very orange and theme is a nice light peach so I couldn't decide what I wanted to wear tonight so I decided to mix both together so this one is Dawn and this one is beam it's going to so I definitely should have added a little less of dawn compared to being because it seemed to have overpowered the Knicks but it did come out to be a much milky or orange compared to the intense orange that is Dawn I'm just going to turn it around and here it is very big Majid so less is more but it also Blends like heaven so
