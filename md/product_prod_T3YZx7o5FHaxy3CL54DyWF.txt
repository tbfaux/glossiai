Body Hero Dry-Touch Oil Mist by Glossier: Three antioxidant-rich oils—Sunflower Seed, Grapeseed, and Oat—deeply nourish, moisturize, and soothe dry, tight skin. To really seal in moisture: apply after the shower on your lightly towel-dried (but still damp) body
Sea Fennel Extract smooths and evens the look of skin tone and helps improve radiance
A sparkling, subtle Orange Blossom Neroli scent (with fresh notes of pear, mandarin, and cypress) faintly lingers on skin for a whisper of "vacation" throughout the day
No stickiness here: the ultra-fine mist absorbs in seconds, leaving skin dry to the touch (so feel free to get dressed immediately and rub your bare legs against your upholstered couch without fear!)
