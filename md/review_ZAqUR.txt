devinkielle reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: clearly my boyfriend has been through it for part 5 in the final step of the brow series I'm just reviewing glossier boy brow and black if you follow me on Instagram then you absolutely know I go to these periods where I do nothing to my brows I don't watch them I just let them grow and be wild and free my brows are really bushy unruly they get super curly at the end and when I do do that my go-to product is glossier boy brow in Black actually don't use anything else on my eyebrows when I'm just letting them grow and kind of do their thing and be wild but we're probably change them it filled them in a little bit with some fibers and it looks Supernatural but just kind of darkens those spaces where I don't grow a lot of hair I put mine through it like everything's rubbed off of it but this product really really works and I enjoy it
