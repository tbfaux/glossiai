tru_beauty reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to review glossier's body roll oil wash which I got in the mail from super great so thank you so much for that I am obsessed with the minimalist packaging it's not a little lock key right here we can pop it off and use and then popped right back on if you want to keep it secure so doesn't like fall over in the bathtub or something it is fragrant and the smell is so beautiful but if you do have a sensitive nose then to be careful cuz it is a little strong smelling but I like that it claims to turn from oil to a froth when in reality it kind of turns more of a Milky consistency compared to frost unless you're like really going out your laddering then it might get a little frothy but it's more milky when it comes in contact with wateralso I was doing a little bit of research of types of body oil washes that you can get out there and for $18 for 250 ml of glossier's this is probably the most affordable one that I found so and it's got a lot of Rich ingredients
