AnneBijo reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey coffee so this is the iconic boy bro so when I first got this I was like woah this is a really tiny but then I realized a little goes a long way you'll need that much product on your eyebrows if you just put a little bit is like it has a lot of product on it so it kind of makes sense why there's a little bit but anyways besides that I actually really like this I find that if you don't have dark brows this really helps fill it in and make your eyebrows look more full and yeah I highly recommend this
