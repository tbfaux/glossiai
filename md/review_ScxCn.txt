emmaa reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so this is me the last products from glossier movie review for now I do have a few more other products derived from their skin care set but I will be reviewing that later this is a stretch concealer in gene 11 as well it is a cream concealer and it starts melting the more you rub it to give a more natural finish that you can barely tell where I put it but I saved you can definitely see how much it does helpI mean I don't I want to save the best for brightening only because I did get the shade that perfectly matches my skin tone so are we definitely still use a separate container if you're going to Brighton but I really do love it I'd like how it is a moisture look cuz I do like a natural look also the packaging is super duper cute and durable
