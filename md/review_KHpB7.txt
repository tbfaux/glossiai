harmonym reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: okay guys so hello welcome back I've made reviews in a hot minute butts and can you talk about the glossy milky oil yes I know I look like I just woke up and that's because I did I need to still go get my coffee but I thought we would start up early I upon receiving this I'm actually a very big fan of the Galaxy and milky I'm trying to get it to focus I've used up a pretty small amount but I really love this for removing my makeup before cleansing I think it is a really good job of removing makeup and one thing that I do like about this is that it doesn't really I feel like it doesn't pull out my eyelashes which is one thing I hate Anna makeup remover and then sometimes I'll take a little bit just in the palm of my hand and take a cotton swab and use that to get around the rest of my eyes and it does a great great job
