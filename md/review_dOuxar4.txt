kylieslifestyle reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: everyone so I'm going to be reviewing the class a Milky jelly cleanser this is the biggest bottle that they sell they also have a smaller bottle this is $18 is cruelty free and I love the packaging it's super cute it's a pump and you can turn it to lock it and I think that's super cool it's a condition face wash it's a super gentle on the skin I'm not going to beat them knowing it right now because I don't need to cleanse my face right now it's my favorite cleanser that I own and it is a bit pricey but you can get the smaller bottle that's like $9 I absolutely love it it's super gentle and it does the job that cleans this year because your face really well and I absolutely loved I give it a hundred out of 10 I love it so much it's 6 fluid ounces and I've used this much and I've had it for a while and it lasts a long time and I love it so much
