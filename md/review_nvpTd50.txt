milamenges reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys this is the glossier cloud paint in the shape of the packaging is so cute it looks like one of those little acrylic paint thanks and you just like that super easy to blend out if your fingers and yeah it doesn't give too much of a color streak thing but you can build it up so it's really easy if you're new to using blush so yeah
