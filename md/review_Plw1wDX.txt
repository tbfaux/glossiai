vanzillascott reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so the next hour 28 products that I want you to tell you guys about is the beach please magic hour buildable luminous color for cheeks so this is sort of like a cream blush it's like Cloud paint or any other of your favorites and this is sort of the texture it's really creamy and buildable the packaging is obviously very cute and cool and honestly a lot comes off on your finger you should probably put less than I put on now but just a little dive into the pot and this is how much you can get so you guys are going to be able to read everything about the founder of the Strand on the out tomorrow but just so you know this is for sensitive skin but not only that's for people with eczema and I have asthma and I have dermatitis on my face so it's really reassuring to know that I can still wear makeup
