kimberlygisele reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: Pokemon chart one so just get into it the first two things I'm saying goodbye to are the glossier cloud paint in the shades of Dusk and storm these will be packaging very cute literally looks like a tubal pink and then I'll go ahead and show you the shades on my ceramic dish so as you can see it one of them definitely pulls more Dusky Rosie the other one is like a terracotta type of berry shade I feel like these had such a huge hype back when kwazii was kind of booming so the main reason I'm saying goodbye to these is there definitely spired they only have a six-month shelf life and I've had these for probably 3 years also I've stopped purchasing from glossiest Brand and I've been loving exploring different blush formula is a good dude just really quick is the Flower Beauty blush bomb this is like half the price statement of product and I've been loving the tart when it flushes in place
