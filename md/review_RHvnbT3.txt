aalaninavarro reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey guys today we were reviewing we lost a boy Rob I have the clear version I have pretty thick brows as it is so I decided to buy the clear version instead of the two did one item is quite small but I do wish that the brush with a little bit bigger to help with application what are my favorite things that I've noticed about this is that it won't leave a film or my eyebrows and won't won't feel like there's something sick of them which usually most of my clear gels will IV use this everyday for about 2 months now and I still have it last in which is pretty good I guess so I do recommend even though it is a tiny amount
