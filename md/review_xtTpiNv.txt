nevibaby reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so in the set that I got from glassy I also got the lead star in the shade van I didn't get the duo that it says I couldn't find van anyway the way that I would describe this color is like a lavender Gray so precious like a little bit and I'm going to die but I'll show you what it would look like like on the eyes Alisha Marie I like it it's a little bit more opaque than I'd like I want to find a couple of dupes for it because I know that Sarah novio has found quite a few and I want to look into those cuz I really like the idea I just don't think it's a bit o cake for me so I guess you could just build it up and add more I like a lot of glitter as you all know I'm like the fucking glitter Queen over here if I could show you all myself I just have like glitter on my shelf
