nickifrances reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hi so I'm sure this is a product that you've all seen before it's the glossier Milky jelly cleanser and I feel like it's in every single person's medicine cabinet for good reason it is basically exactly what it says it's milky it's jelly it's very very light it doesn't sting your eyes because it's made with the same component as within contact solution so you can really get up in there and get that eyeliner out and it smells like rose water which is always a plus for me at least so yeah definitely use this and you're double cleansing situation or if you double cleanse you can use this as your only cleanser but I persons that as a first step in Maya double cleansing routine
