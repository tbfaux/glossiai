mikayla_rose_lynn reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hello everyone so today I thought it would try the glossier boy brow I really wanted to do this review because I have super pale eyebrows and I feel like a lot of the people that have been trying glossier boy brow have like super big beautiful bushy brows are ready and I just don't have anything to work with so I thought I would show you guys how well this works on someone that has super pale eyebrows now I have the shade blond honestly I'm thinking about getting this shade of brown as well just because I think the contrast between the darker brow and the hair looks really good so I like to brush it back at Kometsand then it just brush it down so comparison here
