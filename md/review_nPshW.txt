discobeautie reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: okay so this is the new classy play bite my nails liquid vinylic, play on vinyl and that it can't when I got it you have to click it from the bottom to get the product out and when I first got it you had to click it a lot but I just received threats to come out it's like a sponge applicator Oscar and put some on this is the bright red color obviously but it's kind of like easy to manage like if you want to do a lot or just kind of like a blotted lip doesn't that we have a lot of shine but it's not like sticky and this is the color baby which is like the bright red one but I think I'll be wearing a lot like for the summer so gay like bold go to auction
