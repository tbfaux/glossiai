mikamishelle reviews Wowder by Glossier: hey guys so next I want to talk about powders now I lately haven't been much of a Potter person just because my skin has been like kind of flip-flopping like it's having its moment but in the summer I definitely definitely love lava to set my under eyes and listen to all of my face when I get oily with a powdered I love it because even though I haven't in like media the color doesn't really show a kind of melt into the skin I use it for my teeth on that my under eyes and it doesn't come out throughout the day is not cakey it's not a powdery I mean it is powder but it just doesn't leave any residue it's really easy to work with a kind of melts into the skin and yeah absolutely love it if you're looking for a new powder and you haven't tried any of the wanting to try it try it
