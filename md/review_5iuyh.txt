_emilymarie reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: the last thing to finish off my makeup look is glossier boy brow again this is hands-down my favorite brow product I think it's just super easy to use because it's one product that holds your eyebrows in place but also gives them color at the same time it's adding so much body to your brows and no wonder why they called boy brow cuz it looks like you have like the bushiest eyebrows that look like boy brows so sure how I use it my brows are pretty full as you could tell they just grow like sideways on that sideways but they don't grow up so I always kind of start the middle and then work my way the tail and I'm always pushing the hair up cuz it makes it look like you have like a lot more and it just makes it look more full and then I always do that front of my eyebrow last cuz I don't want that much product I want that part to be super light and fluffy tell the difference
