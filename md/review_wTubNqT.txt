asyed516 reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: okay well this is a review of equal CA concealer I am personally these shade G9 I'm looking medium skin tone so this concealer when I first put it on there is kind of a layer? No coverage that you kind of have to get through but it literally takes like one application to get through then after that it's all coverage baby it does definitely have some color corrector already in it I know it's coming up kind of yellow on camera but it does have some of the peach color corrector which is why it's amazing for the under eyes Hutchings very nice and heavy feels very Lux yeah but it's just a really good everyday concealer for the under-eye area I also do put it on my acne marks it doesn't cover Superbad hyperpigmentation I will turn to buy more full coverage concealer for that but for regular concealer purposes it's pretty good
