callikadlec reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hi guys so today I want to be showing you the gloss face skin tint and I'm doing a review I have the shade medium and I have been using this product for a while now and stay about four months so don't so one thing I say about it it's really hard to get the product out of the bottle and then I don't really know what's the temperatures I don't really know the correct way to apply it like I feel like there's notreally like an effective way like I don't feel like I can use a beauty blender cuz I feel like it's soaks up the product too much when there's not really that much to begin with but I do like that it just gives me so I just use my fingers but I do like that it just gives me that really nice like a light coverage obviously I'm not going to have time to blend it on camera but I will show the last one here is it all black
