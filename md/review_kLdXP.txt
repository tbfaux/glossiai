Jadesosa reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to be talking to you about the Milky jelly cleanser from glassy so I really love this product it's amazing that smells so good I just ordered a bigger size because I'm obsessed with it so this is how it looks when you apply it you just need a little bit and then I sometimes do it with my hands it's very it's clear and then I also use my brush you can use it with water but I feel like without water it's so I usually apply at like four drops I feel like like 1 2 3 4 I got the message so after you're done I just like to pat dry and I think that's the best option so I use this every day and night and I really think you guys should buy to commit such a great product and yep
