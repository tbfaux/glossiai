tangomango reviews Glossier set Lip Gloss and Lash Slick by Glossier: okay so as a sudden loss video this is the glossier mascara time reviewing I really like this one. I don't know if y'all can tell but it's not a very big voluminous mwansa is super duper nice and I really like it has more natural look I'm not wearing it right now because I didn't put on mascara today cuz I don't know I just don't really feel like it cuz they're not going anywhere but I do still really like this mascara it's super nice and super natural cuz I know that like it's a lot of other My Scars are really clumpy but this one does not Clump up at all and I gave you this really nice long lashes without being like clumpy so if you do want like really voluminous like you know lashes and there's not really much care for you but if you want a more natural look which is facing what glass is all about then this is a great Master for you and I really like this I'm not sure the price but I'm pretty sure it isn't that bad because a lot of my scars are like more expensive cuz it is makeup so I don't know I really like the product.
