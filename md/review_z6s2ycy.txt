zameena reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: I have raved about this glass A Lash slick I do think that is underrated because glass is not like in every makeup artist toolbank but I really do think that it does a great job that is my eyelash with and these are my lashes without such a very black. Pigmented but still natural like doesn't look like give me the the benefit they're real lashes which sometimes like are so big and they push up against my glasses these do a good job so let me do this other one cuz they're my license with both both now have the Lash slick on not sure if you can see it but I love how they make my lashes look Supernatural hope this is helpful
