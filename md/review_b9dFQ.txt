ebeck reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: are any of your viewing the glossier stretch concealer in the shade light as most classy product Aram is one that you're meant to apply with your hands I find that this in my life last week I talked about Foundation that was too dark for me as to find this concealer to me too dark for me two yellow into dark I'm so I do wish they would have more sheet options I do love how light this is though it's not something that I put on and then it starts cracking looks awful when it does Kris but it's not it's not super heavy armor eating somewhere someone described as having like more light reflecting properties as opposed to be more full coverage so it does give a nice lifting effect without actually parking lot of pigment
