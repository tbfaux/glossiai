gabreviews reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: 570 review on the glossy a mango bomb.com and is there Universal skin Salve and I've only have this for a few days cuz I just got through the mail but so far my first impressions are I got this smells really good it smells just like mango come to me and to but has a nice Coral tint but I slept on my hand and if you can see here just like on your way once it goes on the tint is kind of lost which makes me a little upset cuz I was hoping to have a nice ever list Coral Sheen but besides that I pretty much enjoy this because it has a nice glossy Sheen but not too bossy that looks like a ring lip gloss and it was pretty expensive for a lip balm but it comes with a decent product and the tubes feel expensive so if you want a nice smelling bomb and you are looking into trying glassy-eyed the mango
