katie3281 reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hey guys it's today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy a skin perfecting tent so this product is just a light coverage Tinted Moisturizer your supposed to look. It on your face and then kind of like use your fingers. Upward to blend it in and it supposed to like cancel out redness and just like you know give you a really light coverage so I wear a lot of makeup in this may make me by us but I don't I would not even say this is light coverage like this barely did anything it just kind of made my face look really greasy when I put it on so I don't really I don't think I'd go as far as to say that I use this as like a tinted moisturizer but I do think that it like really works well as a highlighter like a natural highlight so I apply it's like the high points of my cheeks for like a really really natural like glow I guess this is the kind of product that only works if you have Flawless on textured skin
