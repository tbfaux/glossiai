fourteencarrot reviews Colorslide by Glossier: Cassie play powerslide liner in Brack this is my new everyday eyeliner I have it here on my eyes just lining really tight and I did put the jumbo color on top for a pop of color but it's super creamy it's the perfect brown black which for me black is too dark and brown washes me out so this is just perfect and the application was super smooth that hasn't budged at all I'm really impressed I love the formulaI love the packaging simple you do need to sharpen his pencil which I like cuz you can get it really pointy if you wanted to so anyway for 15 bucks I think it's a great deal I would recommend this liner and that the BRAC is such an everyday color I think it's a great pick up
