preslee reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: I also wanted to quickly review the glossier Cherry balm.com when you first open it smells so good at this kind of reminds me of cherry snow cones or cherry popsicles but it kind of has a color to it like a bright red but when I just put it on my finger and whenever you put it on it doesn't look as bright as it does when it first comes out so it's not as it's not like a lipstick it's just a small tick this is what my lips look like after I applied it and it is over $10 but I would say it's worth it because it comes in this kind of big tube that you get a lot of use out of the consistency is really nice and moisturizing is not like a lip gloss is not sticky or anyting but it's kind of like Vaseline I really like how cute the packaging is and it is cruelty free to so I also really like that
