bellamarie reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: okay so the second step of my brows is brown gel this is one of my favorite products is the glossier boy brow in Brown and you can also just wear this by itself for the gun no makeup makeup look or you can wear over pencil like what I just used but it makes your brows look so good and so but together I freaking love it now my brows are set and ready to go will stay in place and actually fills them in a little bit more but it gives them such a good shape and love is product
