virginiac reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hi guys I'm going to be reviewing glossier's last life which is their mascara this is what the packaging looks like I really like their packaging it's like very minimalist and simple but because of that looks very clean and professional it's really cute so this is what the one looks like it's pretty small but I like how small it is because it's a lot easier to apply than the mascara I compared it to sew on this side I use glossier it's kind of hard to see sorry but on this I I used great lash and the one looks like this and it was a lot harder to applyNesbit looks like but personally I really like the last look a lot better these are to apply and I feel like I just did a better job on that eyelashes
