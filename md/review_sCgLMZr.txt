DestinyD reviews Generation G by Glossier: this has been a what am I go to favorite lipsticks I absolutely love it this is the glossier generation G lipstick in the shade like it is stunning as you can see in the packaging it has like a new kind of berry Rose kind of tent but then once you swatches it's a sheer color like that and it's very building will she canceled it up to however much you want this is what it looks like as you can see it just very pretty this is definitely one of my favorite lipsticks and I'm obsessive.
