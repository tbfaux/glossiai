kylieslifestyle reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so this is the glossier coconut balm.com P packaging on the bomb.com are literally so cute they are cruelty free and you can use it on your lips on your cuticles and on your elbows and it works really good on other dry spots that you might have on your face this is super moist racing in a lot of people compare it to Vaseline and say it's a dipped in Vaseline this is not a dip to vaseline because Vaseline isn't as moisturizing as this and this has a thicker consistency than Vaseline wrestling is more softer than this is more of a thicker consistency is more moisturizing and this is $12 which is a bit pricey but it lasts a long time and I think it's worth the $12 I gave it a 100 out of 10 is my favorite lip balm I absolutely love these they smell so good and I absolutely love these and totally recommend these
