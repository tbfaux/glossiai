glittercrocs reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is the glossy lips are in the shade come this is a packaging and the Shaded solve is a beautiful rose gold shade I'll go ahead and make sure you have applicator looks in the second once you open it up this is how the up a cuter looks like like a wand applicator and the product is at the end I will go ahead and still watch it for you this is one layer of the lead Stars watched on my hand just two layers and I don't know if you can tell but it does build up of paucity so you can fill these up if you want and they are really shiny and glimmer I really like them because they stay put once they dry so they're perfect for everyday
