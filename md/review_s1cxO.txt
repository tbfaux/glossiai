butterandbeauty reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: this is my actual favorite cleanser ever I just finished a bottle or I'm almost done with it so I already have another it cleans the skin so gently takes off makeup not waterproof but it takes off makeup pretty well and it just leaves are really soft and hydrated and not at all strict so I really love it and I recommend it to everyone and it smells amazing
