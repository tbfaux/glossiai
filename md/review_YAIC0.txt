lilyytay reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: Garcia / lake has quickly become my new favorite mascara I wear it every single day I'm wearing it today and I love that it gives my lashes lots of length without ever being clumpy it's super easy to remove just with warm water or milky jelly cleanser this is what the applicator looks like it's a plastic one with super short verses which makes it easy to get into the corner of your lashes if you're someone that likes a curling your mascara this probably isn't for you but I really like it and will continue to wear it every single day
