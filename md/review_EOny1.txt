beautybymonamarie reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: my first review today is going to be on this glossier Milky jelly cleanser I've gone through two bottles of this is my third and I'm like almost halfway done with it so obviously I really like this a lot I uses exclusively as my morning face wash to remove like my night cream and serums and any oils that may have built up overnight it is a very gentle hydrating face wash so it's not going to leave your skin feeling tight or dry the only thing about this is it retails for about $18 on the glass a website which is a little pricey and it does not remove makeup well unless you're wearing a full face of glossier products which are like very sheer and like you know low coverage lightweight if you're wearing regular makeup this is not going to take it off on its own so you'll need I use a different face wash at night to remove my makeup but other than that this is great
