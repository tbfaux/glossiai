georgiajay reviews Generation G by Glossier: so this is glossier Generation G in Lake so I'm actually wearing it right now I just wanted to show you guys what it looks like kind of on my skin tone so I'm wearing about three layers of it I love this product because of how buildable it is the first layer that you put on your lips is kind of very natural and just kind of looks like like lipstick books when you've worn it for a while and I love that about this product I love that it's not drying at all that's the one thing that I hate about lipsticks and that's why I don't wear them very often is because of how dry they make my lips feel and look I hate the chapped lips look so this is a product for you if you hate lipstick
