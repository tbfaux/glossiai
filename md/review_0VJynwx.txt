anamvi reviews Futuredew by Glossier: hi I wanted to review the glossier future do oil serum hybrid I wouldn't say this is a serum but I use it it says to use it as a last step of your skin care routine just for the day for it to give you like a glass skin glow and I wouldn't say this is like a must have product but I really like it and I think it's really nice as like the finishing touch your skin routine so I just wanted to show you how it looks like a sort of with more direct sunlight it gives that sort of glowy dewy glass skin look I really enjoy this product I don't use it everyday because sometimes my skin is a little bit more oily as I have combination skin but I think it's nice
