naomiepp reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: now I'm going to do my brows with glossier boy brow and brow flick Duo and brown every light eyebrows actually don't know why I got brown I think I was always afraid the blonde was going to be too light or too similar plus my route or so much darker than my ends and so it's kind of like rather go dark then light you know I'm saying okay so I'm going to do one eyebrow and then show you and then we'll go from there so this is one eyebrow done a home hopefully there's like a before-and-after difference that's evident just let me showing you this cuz otherwise that's kind of lame what I can see is it this one is more chocolatey unless gray or Toby like this one is so now I'm going to do the other one in fast motion so you can kind of see how exactly I do a little hair Strokes
