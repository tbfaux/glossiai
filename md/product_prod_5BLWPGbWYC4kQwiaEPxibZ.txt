Solar Paint by Glossier: What it is: A weightless bronzer designed to capture the warm glow you get from spending a day in the sunshine.

Why it's special:

The almost-whipped gel crème is infused with Desert Milk™ (a micro-emulsion of plant oils and extracts like Jojoba and Aloe) to condition and nourish, and has a natural-effect finish that blends seamlessly with the heat of your fingers
