latimelessangel reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hi so I will be showing you the glossy A Lash stick and pretty much as the only mascara I really like use all the time so the reason I love this mascara so much is just because I'm just because it's very very natural-looking which kind of is glossier's a esthetic for everything so I use it all the time just because it never really looks like I'm using mascara even though I am and I really love it just because it gives my lashes little bit extra Lang it darkens make sure that all are looking good like as you can see like the site I didn't use any while this that I dare you can see that they're definitely darker and their little bit longer so honestly it's one of my favorites and I love it so I hope you enjoyed
