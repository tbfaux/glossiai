ler101 reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: I have another product glossier lash slick and I Love mascara plus the Air Force's my normal lashes with a lot of coats I'm not going to be comparing it to this mascara on the other side without the crawler this one only took a lot less time than a glass here I compared them to see what the difference could be a Sierra was a little bit harder on the eyes while this mascara was a little bit softer and easier to apply and got here took a lot of coats to get this type of volume while the other kind just took about three stripes I would use it if I didn't have another maskarin hand but it would not be my first pic I hope to see you my next video
