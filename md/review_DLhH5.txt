bbygurlvane reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: play I'm going to be reviewing the new red shade of the glossy lip gloss it's what I'm wearing right now so if you haven't uses before this is the best lip gloss looks like it's super comfortable the product is super thick it's days really shine if the shiniest lip gloss and it doesn't just absorb into your lips like it will stay shiny for a long time because it's so thick it doesn't just come off when you take a drink of a cup or something
