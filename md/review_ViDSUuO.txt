fourteencarrot reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: I don't know I've probably finished 10 of these I really like the glossier Lash slick mascara I haven't opened a new one yet so this is one is empty I haven't opened a new one cuz I've been testing this telescopic mascara which has a similar effect but I really like that the Lash slick I'll probably I think I have a backup I'll keep reproducing it but if you're looking for kind of your lashes but better mascara especially like if you are working from home maybe not putting it on as much makeup or wanting to look more natural and this is a great option I think it's $18 so not as much as a drugstore or more than a drugstore but not as much as like a Prestige mascara so I think the price is pretty good for what you get
