mybeautyycloset reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: Chillicothe boy brow is my absolute favorite product ever like seriously I don't know what I did in my life without this product I seriously don't even fill in my brows anymore that's how much I love it so on days where I am wearing no makeup I'll just do one coat of the sand on days where I'm wearing a full-face of make-up I'll do two coats of this and it looks like I spilled in my brows which is insane I love that it's buildable it has good coverage and it just does not smudge at all and it worse throughout the day if you're someone that hates feeling in their bras or just is not really good at it I highly recommend picking up this product is Affordable
