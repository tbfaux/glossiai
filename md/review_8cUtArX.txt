justinealexis reviews Colorslide by Glossier: this is glossy a color slide in the shade hardcore velvet color slide is a a techno gel eye pencil is how they describe it it's just an eyeliner pencil but I really like the shade is kind of a deep blue-green these are super super easy to use I find the thing like a glide on super super well yeah these I think are going to be discontinued come 2021 I took an email from them so if you're interested in some of the shades they do have some cool unique ones I definitely recommend checking them out I have two of these hours of the yellow shade called nectar yeah it's a really fun product really easy to like smudge out and create a little bit more like it a Imperfect book so yeah
