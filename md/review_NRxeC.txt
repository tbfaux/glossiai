sipeara reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: before I got in last night came out I did not like mascara because it's hard to get off and it made my eyes look black around it and just wasn't good but whenever I got this and I tried it I have not gone back how about like four of them sometimes I just do it on the ends and you can see some part of me is like a cat I cuz I don't really look like wings all the time but this stays on all day and it's so easy to get off and like I've taken naps in it from cried in it and it doesn't by Janis still looks the same but then whenever you take it off it just like crumbles in a good way and I love it so much
