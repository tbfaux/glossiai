laxlauraandrea reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: now it's time for my brows I'm going to be using this glossier boy brow in the shade Brown and it's just a brow gel with color I'm actually almost out and I usually use this when I'm just in a rush or I just want to go for a more natural look and I just fill in my eyebrows and this is how my eyebrows look like if I want a more defined look I would go ahead and use a pencil or something else to just fill in my eyebrows and make them more Define but for today I'm just going to leave it like that but I think it's very easy to use
