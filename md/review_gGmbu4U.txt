karina_zavala reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys I'm going to be doing a review on the glossier Cherry balm I have tried their products before and I personally love their bombs because they just feel so great and this Cherry one I have already tried it I tried it before this video but I just love it because it gives you like a nice tent that's not too over exaggerated and it smells so bad it smells like Curry it's also that I would totally recommend
