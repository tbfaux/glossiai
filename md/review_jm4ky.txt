fourteencarrot reviews Colorslide by Glossier: so I've already reviewed a couple other colors of the glossy a color slide but I wanted to share this pretty penny with you basically what I have done with this is use it as my everyday like work look eyeliner and I just run it underneath the Lash line and a little bit into the wing and I love it I expected it to be more of a bright copper but it is more brownish which I actually left so it's my new favorite neutral my new favorite everyday and it has a little bit of a shimmer it's a little bit lighter than other Brown liner so highly recommended I love it
