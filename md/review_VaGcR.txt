marybridget reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so today I'm going to be reviewing the glassy eye makeup on. Calm and this product I really do like it I got it yesterday yeah I got it yesterday and it smells so good like it smells like exactly like a mango but like better I don't know it just smells really good and it's like in this tube I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger of a too but I like the size of it and I think it works really well for my skin it kind of does take a lot to push it out of here I don't know what to say but doesn't like come out right away like you said I had to like push with both my fingers on here to make it come out cuz it's a super thick formula but I think the packaging super cute it's trendy and its really is actually a good product so it hydrate my lips might like it I reckon
