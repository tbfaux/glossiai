sarah_novio reviews Niteshine by Glossier: Step 2 of this makeup tutorial is to get your shine back because you won't be able to notice him so I have glossier's nightshine and I have the color platinum rose so these are the usual areas that I like to put the products on and then I just blend it out with my finger again I love how easy it is to apply and blend this product and how natural this glow is
