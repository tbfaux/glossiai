vivi744 reviews Haloscope by Glossier: okay guys I also have a Halo scope here in the shade quartz I think it's such a pretty color and honestly it works really great on any skin tone and let me show you right here how do we say it makes your skin look and if this is not bright enough for you you can just layer it and it will definitely fit your needs this is probably one of my favorite highlighters to make you look dewy and just nice and shiny
