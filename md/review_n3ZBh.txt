harmonym reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: okay so next is one of my most recent on makeup purchases along with my favorite brand one of my favorite brand newest launch, this is glossier eyebrow flick basically what this is it's an ultra precise felt-tip brow I don't want to say pencil but like it's really different from anything anybody's ever seen is the thing and so it's similar to like a liquid eyeliner in the way that has his kind of felt tip to it has gotten a little wonky there's like a stray there's like a stray hair on it but I'm learning to like this it's kind of crazy I'm going to do a second review so I can talk about this more because I still have mixed emotions on it so I'm not quite sure yet
