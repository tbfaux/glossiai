nicole1 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy balm.com so I'm so excited to try this because this is my first impression because this is just came in the mail and I'm so excited so that's open this so when I take it out this is what it looks like in the packaging is so cute and like the color of this is so I'm so happy so I'm going to try it now and see if I like it or not it just comes like a tube like this and this is like the consistency it comes with so I applied it to my lips and I put way too much so a little goes a really long way like I put way too much but so far it's not sticky at all it's really smooth and it's feels very hydrating but I got the coconut but it doesn't even smell like it but I really recommend this and I really like it so far so yeah
