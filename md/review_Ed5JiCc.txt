madisenrose reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so I'm going to do part two of this just because I really didn't get a explain everything in the last video so what's so quick so this is the shade at that I got the g-10 and I tried other moisturizers and they are always very drying on my skin so I put this on this morning you said just about every day I have very oily skin and it's like a matte finish and so my skin it works pretty well as they not throughout the day my faces and get exploring oily but is concealer I noticed it's pretty cream on my face or the other concealers that I've tried it like dries up and get some flaky but I'm not a fan of that's why I heard about this and so I wanted to try it out so I would definitely recommend this it's not like super crazy full coverage but it works very well so I would definitely give it a try and it's so cute and you have to have quite a bit so
