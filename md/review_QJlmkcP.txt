augustmollobeauty reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys I'm doing a review on the glass a Milky jelly cleanser first of all I love the packaging it comes with a good amount of product it's like $18 I think but I should talk about the product product so it was a little hard to get off and I didn't like to ask your feeling about this little sticky felt a little weird the ingredients are in the best so there are better cleansers that are cheaper and have better gradients for several the CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser so I write this product of 5 out of 10 there are better options out there so don't waste your money by
