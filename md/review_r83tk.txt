mzudsiri reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: I picked up the Flower Beauty blush bomb in the shade melon at Alta I heard that this might be a dupe for the glossy Cloud paint which is great considering that this is 999 store and one of my friends she's vegan and she really wanted to try the glass A clap hands but she couldn't cuz it's not vegan and surprisingly this formula is ice watched it on my hand I have the cloud paint in Hayes Dusk and beam as well I think that this is a very similar shade to a glasses cloth paint Dawn the texture is more or less the same I would say that the copies are maybe a little bit more like lightweight and water gel like but overall it's basically a tubethis applicator also makes it way easier together
