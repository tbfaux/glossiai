clairewalter reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: I've said before that I don't wear under eye makeup and I generally prefer not to because I think having a little bit of Shadow under the eyes pretty sexy but I haven't felt great this week and the Shadows under my eyes are puffy and darker than usual so before I leave the house I'm going to put on some stretch concealer meal but I've been using stretch concealer for at least 2 years I use stretch concealer and medium and I just apply with my fingers gently under the eyes and any other red spots that I have the reason I like this concealer more than others that I've tried as because it feels quite moisturizing and it moves with the skin rather than taking up I'm going to get this little guy too and there you go bags gone and 30 seconds
