hales412 reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: because so I'm going to be reviewing the glossier priming moisturizer and Rich urvish but it's a really thick moisturizer I got it because I needed a new one for the winter those thicker and it's definitely thick but it's not like to dick in it really like and melt into your skin it's really makes your skin really soft doesn't break you out smells like lavender and I love it
