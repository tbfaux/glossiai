kimberlygisele reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: great show in the previous video I mentioned that I have four of these but I'm puttering 3 so apparently I lied because I remembered I have five I have a rose balm.com and the fake one that I mention that I'm using right because it smells like strawberries it's very pretty 10 or 10 and the rose one I don't have it on my desk for some reason I think it's in one of my bags that one while I do love I feel like my problem with these is like I mentioned they're not very moisturizing they do have beeswax and lanolin which is supposed to be good for moisturizing but I think they're mostly made up like petroleum or troll that one ingredient that's basically like Vaseline and I do love Ashley but in this is just not in front of a greeting in my opinion but the gross one that one does leave my lip soft the big one is just pretty like for smell and the color moving forward. I'm just stick to the boils are very nourishing in my opinion and I'm going to stick to Smith's Rosebud bomb that's what I mean
