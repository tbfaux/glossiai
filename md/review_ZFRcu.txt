hmwright02 reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to be reviewing glossier's lash slick mascara so in this I I curled my lashes and apply to mascara and on this I I just applied to mascara I did not Chrome eyelashes I love the light feathery look it gives my eyelashes cuz I don't like my mascara to be too thick but I think you definitely need to curl your lashes if you have straight lashes
