evajd24 reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: glossier boy brow for me so the first thing I do is just brush my brows upwards with a spoolie brushes to make sure they're going in the right direction and then with the product I just go in and dress them in the direction I want them to lay so after I've done that I'm just going to brush through with my school again to get out any bumps in the product so wisely I just take my eyebrow comb and come down where to get them in the right shape that I want them sassafraz all complete please avoid row only comes in for Shades but I got the brown one and it's perfect for my brows it really really works for me so the only thing I don't love about boy brow is that it is $14 and that's a little pricey for a really small size like this so I think if they just made it a little bit bigger than it would really be worth it
