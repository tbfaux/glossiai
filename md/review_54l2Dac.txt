ReviewsWfran reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so today I finally got my glasses shipping in and all I got was this mango bomb.com and actually got a little sample without beans to I've been wanting this bomb.com ever since I seen you come out I'm obsessed with mango mango is my favorite fruit mango and peaches I would love if they can all the page one but honestly I'm kind of like a little bit like just hurting because like I thought this was going to be a hell of a lot bigger like when you see these pictures online or like when somebody is like posting about it or whatever it's bigger to me for some reason like I don't know maybe it does look bigger like on screen for some reason but like in person it was a lot smaller I don't know I'm still excited to have is it smells fantastic it tastes good and it's very rich and I can tell this to last me a very long time in the package you so cute on
