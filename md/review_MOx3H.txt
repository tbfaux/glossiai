harmonym reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: so it's am here to talk about the gloss a perfecting skin tint now this is one of my all-time favorite products every single time I use this I love and more and more and I also learned how to work with this more and more if you're the kind of person that likes coverage this is not at all for you this is a crazy watery formula and I wouldn't even say this is a foundation this is a perfecting skin tint I take the slightest amount just a couple of small drops and I apply it with my fingers I know and this is something that gives you the slightest amount of coverage really interests tend to your skin to make it look naturally kind of Wallace and it perfect any run but it does not cover up any pimples so this is something that is really great if you really like natural skin and natural makeup
