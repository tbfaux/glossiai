lopezalessandra reviews Hand Cream by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to do my absolutely honest review of their closely and had him. I've never tried to start up so I absolutely love the pink packaging and to be honest it's like a jelly pad and wow when you open it it almost has the functionality of a lighter and so the try the hand cream so if I have cream I would say that it's not very sticky it's very silky and it's very smooth and it almost smells like the perfume of the glossier perfume I really like the texture of it and I absolutely love the packaging of it so I would give it a thumbs up and if I were to read it out of 10 I would say it's an 8 out of 10 I absolutely love it
