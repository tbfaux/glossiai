emmaa reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so another product I have with me is the is the original glossier balm.com now if I'm being completely honest the original at least is just Vaseline in a tube but I have tried the birthday cake one and the coconut one and I absolutely love those they smell delicious I left for the birthday balm.com has a shimmer where is this one it's too much of a saline it comes out very nice and smoothit's like a slight she nothing to of a pint and there's no scent but what I like to use it form is as a kind of eyebrow primer where it is significant that my brows and I put it on my lashes before I go to bed and I know Vaseline helps with eyelashes and eyebrows
