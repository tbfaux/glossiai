thekristynedit reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: if you guys couldn't tell I clearly have a blush tone Obsession and these are my three little babies but this is what the cloud paints look like when they're out of their tubes they are beautiful the bottom is dust the middle is beam and the top is done so my favorite shade out of the three that I own is definitely dust it is just a very neutral kind of brownie pinky peachy blush it just makes you look like you just got a sunburn so that's what it looks like and then being looks like that it is peachy and bright and pretty and I love it that is being and then I'll put a little bit of dust as you can see her. Dusk Dawn so that is what Don looks like I love Cloud paint you got to get them
