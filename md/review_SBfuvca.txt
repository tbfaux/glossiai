fayeparis reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey okay this is my first reviews I'm not really that experience but I thought I would give it a try and I'm going to review the glossier birthday balm.com and I love these I've had birthday balm.com all of these for about like two months and this was almost empty this is one of my favorite I keep is one of my school bag and this one for traveling this one's Rose balm.com is was Meg about the bomb.com and this was birthday balm.com and it smells exactly like birthday cake and it has little shimmers in it which I absolutely love and each one is $12 or you can get it in a set for $30 which you're saving $8 if you would by 3 and yeah so that's that on that the only things I don't really like is that they don't ship to Germany so if you live in Germany you have to either ship it to a family member outside of Germany or you have to compromise and not get it I'm so sorry
