amudaus reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hey what's up guys so I'm going to be reviewing glossier's and milky oil the first thing is the packaging it show so pretty simple minds be like like a baby's bottle like a pacifier or something is so so cute so I put a little bit of the oil onto the cotton pad I'm going to try removing these swatches that I had earlier Samantha makeup really well at left kind of like the oil kind of an oily texture left on my skin kind of similar to micellar water with all like a little bit of oil for all I would say that product to remove my makeup really well how I like the product but this bottles really small it's $14 I don't think we were purchasing it I use makeup everyday I would have to use it everyday and I just don't think it's worth the buck I'd rather buy micellar water as much
