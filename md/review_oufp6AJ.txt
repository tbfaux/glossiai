Brinicole364 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi everyone so today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy eye or glossier balm.com this one in specific is the Rose when this is the only one that I've tried out in specific but I really do like it I suffer with pretty chapped lips or I go through phases so I've been on the surge for a good lip balm I think the texture of it is very similar to vast Vaseline so if you're willing to spend this day like I think it's like $10 for a product quite similar I do believe it's worth it they have all these flavors to choose from I'm very tempted on trying the other one the only complaint that many people have complained about is the packaging is like a like a metal so it's kind of hard to explain about the product and as you can see it kind of like dents the packaging but it's not the biggest deal I think I'll struggle more when I'm trying to get the last bit of the product overall I definitely recommend this bomb
