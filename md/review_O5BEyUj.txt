legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: fifth grade so this is a glossy a coconut bomb.com so just got this yesterday I found it in a winners and is immediately snatched it up so I did notice that the batch code for this look like from two years ago so I was like you know I should probably use it quickly like so I really really love this though like oh my God it smells like coconut cake show me that's what smells like it smells so so good it's not an overwhelming sent like you're not going to smell it from Super far away from you only really smoke when you put in your nose up to it so it's been really nice on my list so I used it as a overnight lip mask and my lips are so hydrated this morning I also think that this is a really good cuticle bomb that night though as well cuz so I have used with bombs as cuticle oil before but that's like usually really really sticky this stuff isn't sticky and it absorbs so quickly and my cuticles looks so nice now so yeah
