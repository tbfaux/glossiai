celestee reviews Super Glow by Glossier: this is one of my favorite glossy products this is the super glow Serum with vitamin C magnesium first of all glasses packaging is one of my favorites you also have a super easy applicator to use it's just a little dropper so you can use however much you want so this Serum is to Brian and energized old tired skin so I applied it all over my face in the morning because it is super light it doesn't leave your face oily so I'm going to just put a few drops on my face there's my dog right there Robitussin so I just rub this product into my skin and as you can see it gives it a nice energized look but my skin does not look oily at all like it's the perfect amount of oil
