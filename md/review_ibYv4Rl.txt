tangomango reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: the next one is going to be the berry bomb.com this one is kind of a scary tent it's like purple but honestly whenever it's actually on your lips it doesn't like make your lips look like you just put purple lipstick on so don't worry about but this one the tint is kind of weird I guess it's not bad and but it's deadly not my favorite but the smell is what I really love about this one it's such a nice smell if you're looking for like a manly smelling you don't really care about you and I would definitely come in this one it smells like blueberries with like a hint of blackberries it just smells like a bunch of berries I don't really know it just smells really good and if you like like blackberries and blueberry type of sense this would be a really really good choice for you overall I really really like this one and it's definitely one of my top three
