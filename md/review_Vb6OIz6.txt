autumnnotwinter reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey super great I am going to do a quick review on the glossier Lash slick if you know me I am a very simple girl when it comes to make up on the everyday I like doing my skin care but when it comes to make up I really just want something that's going to work and this works it is a more about last tent and it doesn't give like super volume or super length or anything but it does give consistency and that's really all I ask for it doesn't flake it doesn't smudge is a long wearing mascara that I can count on it is very black and the wand is one of those plastic spiky ones so be careful you might poke your eye out if you get too crazy with it
