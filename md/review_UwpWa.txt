bellamarie reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey guys so I'm here to review the glossier stretch concealer and as you can see I have it underneath just this I right now you can see the difference on this side my under eyes not as dark and the skin tone is a bit more even this is the only place I have on right now and there is setting powder over it it looks completely natural it lays down so great you just put it on with your finger Blended owl blunts out so smooth this is in medium there is a lighter shade but since it is so sheer and not full coverage I can get away with the not let it shame because as you can see I am very pale yeah this isn't a full coverage concealer so you can't really use it to cover up blemishes when you can conceal the redness of it just make your skin tone look more even and just as a natural enhancement to your normal skin
