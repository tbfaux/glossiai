peneloqe reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi everyone today I'm going to review Cloud paint from glossy 82 gray hair kind of recently I got glossy package so I've already tried out the cloud game this isn't shade beam and it's described as a PG color I love cupcakes they're very pigmented I love the colors I also like the way that they blend but one thing if you get this be so so careful when you're trying to squeeze it out I barely pushed it barely and big amount came out but then that's not too bad cuz that means that there's a lot of product fever while I'm not even going to have to squeeze I'm just going to put my finger there to get some product also as everyone knows the packaging is amazing as usual thank you for watching my review
