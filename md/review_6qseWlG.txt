ninii reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is Generation Z in cake it's really moisturizing actually TV doesn't really work as blush but it kinda does that's the only thing I wish it would do more but I guess there's Cloud paint for that it's really cute I think it's the perfect natural everyday lip and you can really build it up to something light something a little bit more I think cake is a perfect color for like anybody if you don't know what color to get get cake cuz I think it'll suit all skin tones I love you
