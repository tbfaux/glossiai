sarah_novio reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so I'm going to talk about another God's a dip and is the Milani cheek kiss so I got the shade very smooth because it looks very similar to glossier Cloud paint and Hayes I truly think these look identical on me so I'm going to demo both on my cheeks so this is what they both look like it did get kind of messy hair and I really think it's probably the formula honestly these to feel exactly the same I think this just feels a little bit more watery and that's why I kind of did that little messy thing at the end so I'm also not used to the formula so I'll probably just practice more with this one I'm definitely in love with this formula it's so good the cloud pain is $18 and this one is 999 so it's a really great dude there almost exactly identical
