vixnewman reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: coffee bubble wrap glossy bubble wrap is an eye and lip Plumping cream the packaging is super nice super sanitary and hygienic when it comes out it looks like this you get just enough product to do your eyes I like to apply underneath the eye and then also the eyelid area I'm not super gentle with this area and I you should be but that is the last of my concerns personally and then you can also use this is a lip Plumping cream which I really like it makes it locks in the hydration that you're about to put on whether it's Mom. Com or the Laneige sleeping mask or whatever but it really works to lock in that hydration and it makes your lips feel amazing
