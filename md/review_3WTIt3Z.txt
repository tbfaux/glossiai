hqutie reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: to another one of my favorite glassy products is the boy brow I love the natural brow look personally on me and this is how I achieve that so you literally just brush it on there you can build it up or not put as much depending on your desired look for me it really depends on the day so one thing I love is the brush I feel like it really helps you shape the brow while you're putting the color on I feel like some other brand products make it really hard to actually shape the brown the way want to so there is the final look I know it doesn't look like much but I personally love the natural brow look it keeps my brows and place all day I don't think it fixing them up and I can just not worry about it
