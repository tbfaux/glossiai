Kylie reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm reviewing glasses Cloud paint in the shade puff I really like this product it's very pigmented it comes out really quickly in the case which is not really like but otherwise I like it it's very very soft and colorful I don't know if you can see it with this lighting but it's definitely there and I would definitely love to get more colors and like mix it apparently you can do that so yeah
