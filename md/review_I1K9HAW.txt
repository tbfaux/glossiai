christina248 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: today I'm reviews glossier coconut balm.com it is specifically made on lips cuticles elbows and anywhere that needs some love if the smells really strong but super nice and sweet and beaches and it turns your lips a little red cuz it has a little tint to it because the pH levels and stuff as you can see my lips are a little more pink than usual packaging is adorable little hard to come out the first time you get it but I've had mine for a while and it's pretty good I would give that a 10 out of 10
