taniags reviews Solution by Glossier: hi this is glossier exfoliating solution it says to use everyday but I like to use it two or three times a week because even though it is not a scrub it's still is a chemical exfoliator that works with acids so I don't like to over exfoliate my skin I take a cotton pad and I usually do about four pumps and that's enough to cover my entire face it absorbs very quickly into the skin so I really like this product it has really helped me getting rid of the texture that I used to have in my forehead and it has holes or brighten my skin tone so if you're looking for a chemical exfoliator this is a great choice
