lilyjordan reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: embracing reviewing the mango bomb. Combines RCA and I also have these ones that I got I say my favorite is probably birthday but I'll review this for you so you really look like a mess but this is the mango flavor and I really like the color and I really like the color of it it just looks like that that is what the car looks like it's a really pretty like pinky orange a color I really like tired of it the scent is it's a little bit strong enough I like to say a good strong for me so this is what it looks like Swatch it's like Vaseline e texture is really nice I really like this app, I just wish this phone wasn't as much that's my mango is my least favorite
