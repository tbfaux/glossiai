christaallen reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: glossier boy brow if you've watched any of my other reviews for brow products you'll know that I'm pretty passionate about work how to say the boy brow is not my favorite I feel like it's hard to be exactly as precise as you want to be it's not as buildable as I would like it to be so I don't know maybe it's just not quite right for my brows maybe it's better for someone who has like a smaller bra and once a very little but it's not like that bold if you know what I mean I do like that it stays pretty valuable throughout the day it's not like hard or crunchy and this is obviously the color brown
