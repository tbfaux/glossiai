mallorydean_ reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: and I was so today I'm going to be talking about the glossier boy brow I use it so much that the boy brought actually got rubbed off of it but so I really like this because it's not super intense because I don't like to have super like sharp brows I just like it's like natural and feathery so I just take it and brush it through my brows and it leaves like a light hint because my brows are kind of like and so it'll just take them and make them more defined and just make them look not messy and you're absolutely love this product and you guys all go check it out
