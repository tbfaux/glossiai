Maxx and all that so but I haven't found anything until today so I finally found a glossier balm.com it is the coconut one I don't like it isn't my absolute favorite thing from glass hey. I was just so excited to see it I just had to have it I've never tried any of these bombs so yeah I'm definitely super super excited to try this is how I got it for $8 rather than the normal $15 so hell yeah since I was already there and buying something I caught myself another nail polish from Sally Hansen color therapy 50 Shade will will will and a satin shower cap cuz I don't have a proper shower cap right now
