theozhang reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey guys so today I'll be reviewing the glossier boy brow this is when they're cult favorites and honestly I really really like this product but I did have some issues with it for some reason glossy products are waxy always break me out except for the stretch concealer but like this product and also the bomb.com those both broke me out like this one I love love love using it and how it looked it makes my eyebrows look so feathery and beautiful and it's really natural and really good for someone like me who doesn't really like doing their brows like I can do them I just don't like to see thembut it just even after a warrant for maybe like 3 hours for an event it would break me out like these tiny tiny little pimples and it's the most irritating thing ever because they're in my eyebrows is horrible so but I really like the look of them so I do it anyways I just deal with a breakup
