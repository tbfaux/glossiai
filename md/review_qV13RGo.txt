victoriaaa- reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: but I have with me right now is the glossier balm.com I have it in Rose and coconut so it's froze you're going to get a slight pinkish tint their lips but with coconut you're not really going to get anything it's more than just like a sheer regular lip balm I say that these products are pretty good because they're really moisturizing and they smell incredibly good but I would have to say that for the rose when I put on my lips it does leave white residue after maybe 15 minutes but maybe it's just me but I'd still recommend this
