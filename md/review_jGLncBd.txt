coolkate17 reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys so my name is Caitlin and I don't really do stuff like this that often but I feel like there's a lot of people that don't know much about makeup look like and I thought it'd be fun to do one of the reviews I went on a huge glossy a that's how you pronounce it I used to call it glosser which is wrong its glossy a binge and so I bought one of those things that just really caught my eye and it is the cloud paint here and it's like down and the color I got was Dawn so what Don supposed to do is kind of make it look like you have a bit of a tan a little bit on here here here oh my gosh I might have put too much on it
