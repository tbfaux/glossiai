meesh_97 reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey guys it's just be glossier stretch concealer I've been using it for a while I do like the product it has sheer coverage and you can just Build It Up the only problem is that it starts to crack and dry after while so I think when I'm gone to some not going to get this anymore but I will show you how I use itthat's so you can see that there's some color it Blends in really well after a while. Probably not feel like it
