styleitwithsofia reviews Haloscope by Glossier: hi guys I'm back from other review I'm severe from Silas fan Instagram and let's get right into it so today we have our glossier haloscope this I Love Dose the bottle does get a little dirty and I'm praising person with it this is what it looks like so there's a little criminal me outside its the highlighter this highlighter is very very like it's not too much it's very subtle so I like to wear to school but if I want more pop up with this and then I will put a powder hi there on top I really like the packaging of this but I just don't like how you feel like this it's like really annoying because it tends to become the product and you don't really get that much product for $22 but I still love this product and I like how we have the option of going like this so yeah let me make sure you guys are closed up with it so this is it possible that is really cool
