thechicmachine reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: hi everyone your favorite Slytherin is back to show you how she keeps her skin not scaly I have the glossier moisturizing Moon mask I have been using the stuff for years it is absolutely amazing I use it a thick layer at night as a sleep mask and I actually leave it on overnight instead of washing it off but you can wash it off I just like to leave it on cuz I very dry skin and sometimes if it is just bitter cold wind is going and everything I'll use a very thin layer of it in the morning and it's better than like a regular thinner moisturizer so this stuff is literally the bee's knees It Last Forever it's only $22 like I highly recommend this stuff
