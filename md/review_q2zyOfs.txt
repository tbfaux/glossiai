amberfarmer reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so today I am reviewing declaw CA bomb.com these are the three that I have on me I have bought five other ones the three 4:30 is the best deal on my favorite one is the coconut one however they are kind of expensive 12 bucks I only use them for a lip balm that you can use in the same as you would Vaseline I duped these are the Vaseline Lip Therapy used for the pictures but these are nice if you're into luxury Brands I would recommend these though the coconut what's the best
