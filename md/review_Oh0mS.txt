abooogie_ reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: and I forgot this which I was very excited about because the one in bomb.com for a while but it's hard for me to spend what it cost for lip balm now I think that definitely is worth the price because just from wearing it today I can feel the difference on my lips if you have nurse they are supposed to live in a cold I have really dry lips sometimes make a kind of craft and like nothing works anymore and I don't know why but this has been working for me I want it almost all of today and I just put some on right now has like apinkish tint Idaho the shape Cherry it smells amazing me not glossy I just hit it out the park almost all the time so I'm definitely if you need a really good lip balm and spending the money I think that it's pretty good so far and I think it's worth the investment seriously
