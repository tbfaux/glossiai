thekristynedit reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: tell me how I have never talked about boy brow like how long have I had my super great account and I've never mentioned this this is like a OG products from glossier this is just a very nice brow gel so I don't have any brow gel in my brows right now I just have them very lightly filled in so I'm going to go ahead and apply to this brow and compare look like when they have it when it in when they don't so let me go do that I am so awkward today holyshit okay so this brows done as far as not I think that it makes the sprout look a little bit more like this for all my brows are very like long distant cousins they are not even close to being sisters or let alone like twins so yeah I like the way that it makes my butthole look it looks a lot more fool lot more defined and I'll go ahead and put in this Pro my brows are now how you could say snatched so yeah I love boy brow it's so so
