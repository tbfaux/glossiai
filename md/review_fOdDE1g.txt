alysonrose reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: then I finish off with just a little bit of a good lip balm to keep my lips nice and hydrated I meet finishing up this little tiny glossier balm.com it's good so I wouldn't spend the amount of money that it cost to have it but I enjoyed getting a sample of it and it is if it's a good chapstick or a good lip balm whenever you want to call it but it's not like like changing life-altering so I would say you're going to buy something from glossy a maybe pick something else this is fine it's just fine
