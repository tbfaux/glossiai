thekristynedit reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: guys if you can't tell how much I have used as lip gloss due to the fact that there are pen marks from it being in my back pocket when I worked well then you got another thing coming if you want to have the most juicy and like voluptuous looking lips and then you need this lip gloss it is a decent price point for as long as it lasts and as long as it lasts on your lip and makes your lips look so juicy and honestly like wet sometimes I actually think that this with glasses a little bit too glossy but it makes your lips look really healthy and it's just so pretty I get compliments anytime I wear it like it just it looks so good and yeah it's just a really good lip gloss I highly recommend it and this little Chief is last to me over a year so
