dancer2007 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys stay I'll be reviewing the glossier rose balm.com this is actually on the pricey side and it does not do much to your lip balm that Vaseline couldn't do it just adds a really nice send and some of them have a tent this one has a light pink tint but after maybe one or two months this product started to get liquidy instead of a sticker form so I don't really know what happened about that but maybe it was just expired which. Does seem a bit early Freddy it to expire but yeah if you like lip balms that are scented and have a tint to them I definitely recommend this just this these products did not work out too well for me
