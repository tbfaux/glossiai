zenyoubih reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so I don't know about you guys but I don't ever do my makeup at home from just laying at home just because I hate washing it off later in the night I take naps throughout the day and the idea of me taking a nap with makeup Philly on my face does not sit right with My Soul but at most if I'm ever doing my makeup at home because I'm going to do a video call with like my boyfriend and my friends and usually I don't even know what my friends to be honest sometimes I will do my brows at most I'm going to do a little mini tutorial and how I do my brows very very simple nothing Supernatural like I'm not even going to grab concealer anything so we're going to start with glossier boy brow and just freshen up my brows a bit so the key with this product is to do what kind of like upward motion so I kind of get a rid of fullness to your brows especially if they're thin like mine as you go
