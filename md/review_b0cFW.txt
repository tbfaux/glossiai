Banannabash reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so this is the glass A boy brow this is the applicator and it's a pretty small too but I've been using for about a month and it's still going pretty well I've actually got it on my eyebrows right now I think it is a really fantastic job filling in your eyebrows I did try I'm a slightly less expensive do but I tried to Pixi brow Duo and it really didn't work and this is only like two bucks more so I would highly recommend just getting a glass
