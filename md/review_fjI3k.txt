Twoheadedcat reviews Lidstar by Glossier: okay let's figure out why everyone is obsessed with the glossy lip start Duo I'm going to do this one on Lily and Van I'm going to do lily as the base and sit spider and do a little bit on each side Paladin it's super creamy and easy to apply it's very soft and supple and do a little bit of fun and increase your the final of the colors were super easy to blend and it's very subtle so I like that it's nicer summer where you don't want to have a bunch of cakey makeup and yeah it was easy and quick and fast and has increased at all so I'm totally into it I recommend
