abbeyford reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so this is my favorite lip balm at the moment it's super moisturizing and has a little bit of glitter in it and it smells so nostalgic so I put this on my lip and then if there's any left over I'll put it on the high points my cheekbones are on the tip of my nose because it does have that little bit of glitter in it and I wear it all day it's the perfect phone with a little Sparkle
