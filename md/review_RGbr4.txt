sheaintcool reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so following my first impressions the actual review play freshener on nothing is scripted this is great my usual mascaras are the ones I like like big and dramatic for like when you're putting on falsies which I am in love with put on fake lashes this is so much better like this precise its natural looking so when you want to put that mascara on top of your lashes this is like this is going to be my go-to now you can see it so nice natural look not much lift maybe I'm Asian so it's really hard but I'm really liking like it just makes it a little darker and doesn't look like two extra especially when for look where you want to look like you're not wearing makeup I mean I'm not right now my skin is just popping but I'm very happy with my purchase so if you've been hesitant to make an order I say put an order but be mindful of how you can recycle everything
