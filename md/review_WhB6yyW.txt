AnneBijo reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey hey hey this is the glossier stretch concealer so the Forsaken notice is wow this is so empty but when you open it you can see if that there's actually a lot of product because when you wear it you don't actually need that much it gives you a nice coverage very sheer and light if you're looking for a more natural look plus the packaging is very aesthetic which is a plus for me and yeah I highly recommend it
