glowwithme reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is glossier cloud paint in beam it's pretty pigmented and it's super spreadable and buttery if you're looking for a Natural Glow this is that if you're at all concerned about whether this is worth it or not I would say that it is because it is a small too but this has lasted me for about 8 months
