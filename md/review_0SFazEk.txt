fourteencarrot reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: okay I think this is the third Ralph like that I've emptied this is my favorite brow product to fill in my brows I like it better than a pencil I need a pencil that I've tried this is my natural brow I don't have anything in it right now but the blond is really a perfect match and I'm able to fill it in where needed but still keep it really I really natural look which I prefer I think the price is right I think it's 18 but it lasts and lasts me at least man for five maybe six months so highly recommended Sproul flick especially if you like to kind of draw them on or you have patches that you need to fill in but you have kind of fullness elsewhere highly recommend I already have a backup ready to go
