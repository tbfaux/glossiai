elizabethhhloves reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so these are the glossy eyelid Stars I have a 2 of them I have Cub which is a beautiful rose gold shade and also van which is this topi purpley brown shade I love both of these the only thing I would say is that if you were to apply it I would apply it straight from the applicator to your eyes and then I wouldn't touch it with my fingers because as you can see so when you apply it it's beautiful there's pigmentation there it's not sheer but as soon as you blend it it becomes so sheer and muddy looking at is not even doing the shade the same thing happens with this I would recommend if you want to use this kind of an eyeshadow and you want a soft Edge I would take a fluffy brush and just kind of blend out the edges instead of taking your finger with it because when your fingers are just as you can see his money but
