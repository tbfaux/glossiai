amudaus reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey what's up guys it's Jay and going to be reviewing the glossy lid Stars I currently have a four of the six shades to slip this is the shade Fawn this is cub and this is Moon so I have all these swatches of them I have slipped van cub and Moon so these are sites have a portion of ultrafine multi colored pearls suspended with coated pigments in a Buttery base for the silkiest and most blendable formula and I would have to agree these are very blendable as you can see he's a blend really nicely I have let them sit for a while so they're not letting out nicely but they blend really nicely into like a sheer iridescent pigment for your eyes
