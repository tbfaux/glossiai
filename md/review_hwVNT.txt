Beautaf reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: okay so here it is high shine lacquer vanillic so I got this in the color Tony and I'm so excited first of all I actually tried this in the store so I can't say it's in the first impression I just got back from LA but how cute is a packaging this is so different from everything else gone see is made it is really really high shine like it suggested it's actually is very comfortable to wear to where's I'm very picky about glasses but this is super comfortable really loves the the pain as well there's a bit of product on my pen okay what what's cool about it is you just click you can see the little holes right there the product comes out and you have this really really pretty felt tip
