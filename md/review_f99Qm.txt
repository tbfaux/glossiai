lilyytay reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: this is the new mango bomb.com from glossy which is the perfect summer lip product in my opinion that this is quickly become my second favorite bomb.com after coconut it smells exactly like mangoes super sweet and tropical and reminds me of a summer vacation it says that it's supposed to have a slight Coral tint but I don't really notice that on me but that's okay I love the colors they chose for this packaging and I also love that it comes with fruit stickers which I'm going to be sticking on everything I own ASAP
