j-napz reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: in the last step of my routine is glossier priming moisturizer rich I already put it on my face super great cost again I think I need to update I'm not sure but this isn't okay product I'm not obsessed with it I think it's a little pricey the full-size so but so is the moisturizer I currently use which is the Clinique Moisture Surge but I like that better cuz it's a gel consistency and not a cream consistency but all in all I think it's a good product it all depends on preferences obviously in skin care is so like subjective but it's not a bad product and I use it in the morning it's fine it's okay
