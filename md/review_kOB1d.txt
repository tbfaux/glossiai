courtneyy reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: I'm going to review the glossier balm.com and Rose like all their glassine packaging the bomb.com packaging is just so adorable that says you can use it on your lips cuticles anywhere they need some love has a very pretty pink color to it the texture is so sick I love it and I really just like the way it makes my lips look when I put it on I think it's very pretty in the pink really shows through and this is what's keeping my lips moisturized and helping them not fall off completely during the winter it's very thick almost like a Vaseline to texture but it doesn't feel suffocating I probably going to apply about three times a day and it keeps it moisturized all day long and if you go to sleep with Banda, your lips you wake up in the morning with your lips feeling moisturizing almost like you're still surprised left on there
