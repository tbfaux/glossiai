naomiepp reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: so it's winter and I just had that whole pumpkin spice face Max debacle and my face was kind of dry now like I let's are so chapped that yesterday when I was at class I was like biting my lip and I made it bleed so hard I had to leave the room because it wasn't stop bleeding and it was like dripping so let me explain to you what I use on my face first and foremost after any treatment or after washing my face first thing in the morning yeah it's this it's the glossier moisturizing Moon mask so I use about this much and I know that this is something that you're supposed to put on leave on for about 15 minutes and then wash off but for me I find it works best as my hyaluronic acid treatment so instead of a moisturizer I use this as the very first thing I put on my face after cleaning it or treating it and I put all my other products on top of it
