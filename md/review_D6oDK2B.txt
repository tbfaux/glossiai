zameena reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: this is the glossier Mega greens Galaxy Pack face mask and as I applied this today I wanted to share this amazing texture look at that so those little bits that are inside which I could not tell you what they are off the top of my head they are really amazing 1 exfoliating and so I already started to put it on my chin but I want to share what it looks like when it's still wet and then one still dry here's the mask on my face I wish I had a little brush to apply this but anyways I hope this told down some redness on my face after 20 minutes this is what it look like it tingles a little and it feels great
