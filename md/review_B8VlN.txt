l_eila reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey so today I want to talk about the glossier Lash slick and I really like the stuff because it's really nice for like everyday natural makeup and it really accentuates your eyelashes in a way that's like not too over-the-top or not really that clumpy does a really nice job of like curling them and lifting them up and still making them look sort of natural and it doesn't leave like this dark smudge marks under your eyes and the Fallout is very minimum and its really nice for like an all-day wear
