kelseylynne reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys I just wanted to review the glossier balm.com in the mint scent I tried a few of their sense in the past but this one has to be my favourite untinted sent so far you can use it anywhere from your lips cuticles elbows on your friend anywhere that needs some love super cute packaging and when you use it it gives a slight tingle on your lips I like to use it before I go to bed just because it is untinted but this definitely is my favorite chapstick at the moment
