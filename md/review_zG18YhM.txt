_kemosabae reviews Lidstar by Glossier: okay so I'm super excited about this this just came in the mail today it is glossier lidstar and it's in the shade moon going to go ahead and try it okay so you can see how you sit on my eyelid here and I kind of wish that it showed up a little better this is two layers of it and it's still not extremely noticeable but it might just be my skin tone but it's still think it's like an easy little natural look for when you're in a hurry
