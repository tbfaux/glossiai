dryskinreviews reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay so this is Terry 28bh please luminizer tinted balm thing in the shade magic hour got it from super great I use it for the first time yesterday it stayed all day as a lot of lasting power to swing comparison to things like glossier Cloud paint also use I will try this on Entry Outlet is very pigmented too much on like we matter but this is pigmented so be careful I really like that it looks kind of like a natural flush and that it also has some shine to it and to be a little bit patchy and I experienced so yeah I really like it I would definitely repurchases in the future
