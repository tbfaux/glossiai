macyrcrawford reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi Sarah I want to review what I used for my blush and my lips today I used to be a glossier cloud paint in Hayes this can be like a very intense color if you build it up to me but since I am lighter skin tone I wanted it to be more sure I didn't put that much product on and I didn't want a lot less anyways so I used like very little but I also used it on my list today I'm not sure if Kelsey advertisers that it's safer that so don't come for me if you use it like that and something happens but I feel like it was a nice way at to use it as a multipurpose product I feel like it Blends great I like to use on a brush most people use their fingers I think but I just struggling a lot with my finger so I think brush works great and it works pretty well throughout the day I think it gives you a nice skin like finish
