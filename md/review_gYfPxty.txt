leana reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey dude I'm reviewing and unboxing the glossy plastic the packaging looks like it just says lash thick on the side it has a little glossier logo and on the back of just gives me instructions and ingredients I also really like how glossies cruelty free and on the sides just pickling pink when you open it up the product is right in there this is what it looks like outside of the box did Lil G for glossy on top and on the side dipstick the one looks like and it's really easy to apply I can see lashes that all natural look but if you like a more dramatic look you could build on it and curl your eyelashes and it gives them a nice flare and the cute guy looks so I really like it 10 out of 10 I would recommend it to you guys once again glossier lash slick
