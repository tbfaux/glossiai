JayciNicole reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: can I just wanted to quickly review this glossier body hero body wash I actually got this from super great forever ago and I just never reviewed it was kind of weird like it's leaking on me just from holding in a little bit other than that the packaging was really cute and nice I love the pump bottle for in the shower too easy to use so here's what it looks like before it's wet so it's an oil and then you mix it with the water and it's turned into a wash through really really like this body wash actually it's grown on me a ton at first I didn't love us and I didn't really love it but I do now actually I feel like it layers really really well with most perfumes I'm especially their class e a u which is my favorite and its really really moisturizing to at least my skin super-soft from I think it's all the oils in it and yeah I would recommend I think it's a really good body wash thanks for watching
