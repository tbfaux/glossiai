priscilla reviews Skywash by Glossier: look what just arrived at my doorstep yes akwasi a package with Sky wash I have the shades Echo and Tara and I'm going to Swatch them kind of like a little First Impressions I'm a zit on my arm though this is what they look like when you open them out of the box they feel very like when they are removing markers or something but very cute these are similar and shade but I feel like they went best with my skin tone this is Echo and kind of Blended a lemming blend it out this is Tara and let me blend them both out so this is it kind of Blended out and I'm just waiting for them to dry but this is kind of what it looks like after a blended a little bit okay I would say they took about like 45 seconds to dry but this is them dried down and I love the colors I can't wait to try
