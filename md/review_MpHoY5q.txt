theozhang reviews Niteshine by Glossier: hey so today I'll be reviewing the glossy peel pearl night shine until Pearl so this is basically a liquid highlighter it goes from liquid cream and Julie nicely I have an excuse me girl makeup right now but yeah if you can see it it's really nice looks gorgeous and you can really get it to look natural or certain so I know it where the sun daily basis and I also wear it for more intense makeup like this makeup and it looks really nice because the pictures nice it doesn't emphasize texture and so I definitely recommend it
