helenemmert reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: so this is the glossier skin tint in the shade she ate oops my bad and this Foundation of skin tint provides very minimal coverage which is really good like a natural log and I love everything about this really hydrating I love how most try to sing it is it's really good to use for like an everyday look not too strong not to stick it doesn't feel happy it's not cakey and this perfect feel like a natural everyday look at least like a do we look for skin and this is actually a little expensive I forgot the price but for the price and the size I would say that you can find a better do just Summer online but overall I love this skin tint Foundation
