amandalynch reviews Generation G by Glossier: I'm wearing glossier generation G and crush it is a new formula I never bought crush with the old formula at a couple other colors I'm not a pink lip person so I never really thought to try it but but the Black Friday sale I kind of just went for it so first impressions on the new formula it's still the same you can make it to your or thick if you want I applied a lox I want to see the color it's still mad not very hydrating so I would recommend layering bomb.com either under or over it if you do it under it'll definitely give you a little bit more of a sheer color which is normally what I do but overall I like it on I'll definitely try and wear it out see how it wears throughout the day but I definitely want to play this much next time
