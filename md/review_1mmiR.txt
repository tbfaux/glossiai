Ellisedp reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hi I said one of you comparing glossier boy brow with Kylie Jenner's extra hold gel first of all the brushes are very different as you could see the boy brow and glossy as well as smaller and it's the same size all the way around however Kylie Jenner's one is not always thicker but it has an end part there that sticks out as you can see on a rotated it comes out a little more I'm not sure if you get off no short clips but the main difference in applying it is a big loss a boy brow comes out as a lot thicker and you could see the glow white tint to it so that the feelings a lot more blending as overall I think harder to use my eyes because of the bigger applicator and the thinner gel and made it easier to apply thin gloss day however I do think with a thicker gel glossy might stay on better for longer
