georgiajay reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hello lovelies today I'm here would be glossy 8 bomb.com which I'm sure is no stranger to anyone on this app these literally are so good like I don't leave the house without them they got like a little bit goes a long way and I also love the fact that there is skin Salve so it's not even labeled like as a lip balm so I use it like especially when I'm sick and I'm blowed my nose a lot I put it here like on my nose and it's really good for that keeps my nose like really hydrated they smell and just look phenomenal on your lips like it makes you look like you're wearing lip gloss but your not so like I stated a little bit does go a long way so these lost a long time which for me justifies the price of them cuz I know they are kind of expensive but if you do buy them in a pack of three you say $5 which is always a plus but yeah I love these
