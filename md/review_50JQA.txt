discobeautie reviews Lidstar by Glossier: okay I'm sorry I bought two of these recently in the little Duo the lid stars and I'm a huge go see a fan if you watched any of my other reviews but these I wasn't super impressed with her and I just saw you the swatches so this one is the champagne anyone is noon and then the more Dusty Rose one is so I love this and I use them I don't have any on right now but I just feel like they don't last all day like by the end of the day they'll come and just fall off maybe I'm not using the best like wood primer for I like them I go on really kind of you can blend them super easy but I don't know I'm just not impressed yet maybe I need to give him another try or wood primer but not sure about him
