abaldleo reviews Colorslide by Glossier: hi guys I'm so today I'm going to be reviewing glossy play color slide eyeliner so as you can see I've got multiple colors I really like this product it goes on really easily not a good person so I don't like spending a lot of time doing it the color goes on really easily it could last a little bit longer on however for the price point and the colors that they have I can't really complain the one that I'm wearing right now is there blue one it's called early girl it's sort of a bluish gray I have brown eyes so I never really thought that I could wear blue just cuz I thought it would look really tacky however out of the four sheets that I have and I have you know sort of warmer colors and not really cold ones I thought that I couldn't wear it but this is actually my favorite one out of all of the place you play color slides so thank you for watching this is a good product for sensitive skin
