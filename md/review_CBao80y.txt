s1210 reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: I finally listened to all the hype and picked up a glossier cloud paint in the shade dust their packaging is adorable let me smash it for you guys so this is a really pretty color when I got it I was afraid it would look too dark on me because I have fair skin as you can see but it's not it's super pretty it Blends nicely it is seamless like it says I like that it's buildable so you can build it needs a little bit it last pretty much all day and it works well under Foundation like if you put it on before foundation or over doesn't look patchy it is a little pricey so I haven't tried any of their dupes yet but I might in the future because I really like the concept of liquid blush
