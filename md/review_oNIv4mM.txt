christaallen reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is a brand new product from nudestix of the magnetic clip plush paint this is the package that comes in which is super cute features work by this artist and all of nudestix packaging cuz I'm Iranian and this convenient carrying case fits a few of their products the plush paint itself reminds me of a glossier cloud paint it comes concentrated and then you blend it out with your finger on the idea of how this plush pain is that you can use it on eyes lips and cheek so it's one product that kind of does it all I would say the way that it Compares with the glossier cloud paint is this is actually a little more moisturizing and this color is Bahama Mama this product will make my life simpler if it's a yes from me it feels really good on the skin and I will update the
