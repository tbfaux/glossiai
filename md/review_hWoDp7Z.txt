butterandbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay now we're up to storm which is described as a warm Rose I'd say it has a bit more of a brick color just cuz it is a little bit longer than that and it cannot hear or brownish depending on the lighting like I find here and on the camera it looks a lot more Brown than it does but it's actually really nice in person so hang on did my same technique and see I definitely I like that it couldn't kind of duel as like a contour / blush so yeah so yeah I'm just tired of left as you can see it for at least for me as someone is very pale skin and someone who gets flushed naturally very easily I have to be very very light with my hand of this because the side is a very clear example of when I applied too much but in general I love this shade and I also love it on my lips
