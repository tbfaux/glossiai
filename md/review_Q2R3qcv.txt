annafugh reviews Haloscope by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm reviewing the glassy a Holo scope highlighter I use it in the shade quartz so this is what it looks like it's just this like stick highlighter and it's very creamy I'm just going to roll it up and down it's really easy to apply so when I apply it I just applied straight to my face and I just go up and down a couple times like that and then I just Blended in with my fingers I know this is kind of hard to tell the difference on camera, but it is a very subtle highlighter but I don't know if he can just going to see it right there I'm that kind of looks like a really natural sheen on your face rather than like a really packed so I'm like caked-on highlighter so I went ahead and applied to the face I put on my nose by then she Maestro be a little bit above my eyebrow
