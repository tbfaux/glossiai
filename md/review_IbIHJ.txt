sarah_novio reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: hey so I want to make an impromptu review on glasses that stick I'm not a proper skincare bloggers so I apologize for my lack of language but this has .124 ounces in here Elsa has 5% benzoyl peroxide and when you open it has a little metal bead and twist it and the product comes out from the bottom and they just rub on your spots and someone that suffer from acne I think this is worth a try
