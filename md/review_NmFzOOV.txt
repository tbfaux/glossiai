jannakrystal reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: LA CA Cherry balm.com is a cult classic staple and a winter favorite for everyone not necessarily the Cherry balm.com but the bomb.com in general this smells just like Terry's I love it so much I could see was a little tint I have it on right now but I'll show you guys so this is what the bomb looks like as you can see it's red but when you put it on it goes light pink and sheer color and it really does hydrate and moisturize your lips so good and yes I really do recommend you try this and I love it so much
