oliviahickly reviews Lidstar by Glossier: okay this is like my first bad review so yeah let's get the Citgo I'm going to be reviewing the Saucier lidstar and shade Moon so I bought this in hopes of you know like having a nice eyeshadow and maybe it's just the shade maybe I like the other Shades but this one's just to buy and it doesn't show up at all leaves like this transparent glitter and not a fan of that I like pigment on my eyes so I wasn't a fan of this imposter paying $18 for this. That's a bit much I would much rather buy the milk makeup pigments or Chanel pots because you're getting more formore for more I don't know and you kept you so much of this and that so quickly and they don't get in another shade but I don't like this one that much
