AndreaIslas reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hello today I'm talking about the glossier Milky jelly cleanser I've had this for quite a long time but I stopped using it because I thought it was pretty basic to be honest but I'm running out of my usual cleanser so I'm using this one again it's good I mean he has a really nice natural roast send but I feel like it doesn't do much for me skin it does feel very hydrating to be honest and I mean it's okay I wouldn't do something for every day I feel like I need something more as you can see my skin is not the best but yeah I just wanted to tell you that I can help
