anna3815 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so this is one of my favorite products if by glossy a it's called Birthday balm.com it's extremely hydrating and it actually adds a nice like sheer color to your lips so I'm going to apply it but this before and this is after and it really moisturizes your lips and it's extremely smooth so if you ever get chapped lips this is such a big help it smells so good and it just works really well I'd recommend it because I probably had this for three months and I'm still not out and I use it probably about every single day and also it's not that expensive it's only $12 for this big tube and this goes well if you're going to use other glass a product on top of it is just a coder
