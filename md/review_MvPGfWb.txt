kelseylynne reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: glossier's stretch concealer I have the shade G9 and I picked this up a few weeks ago and I'm obsessed with it I love this concealer because it gives you a super dewy finish and makes your makeup look really natural and it's really easy to apply I've already applied most on this side and I'm just going to finish this side some parts of my nose and where I get a little bit of redness so as you saw I use my ring finger and I just tap in the product I don't use a brush to apply it but I think it does an amazing job it gives you that no makeup makeup look and it's definitely for more of a natural light look I wouldn't probably use this if I was going to an event with heavier makeup. I think it does the job for every day
