lonnekemckinney reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hello so today I'm going to be reviewing glossier boy brow why have you stayed blond and I am currently wearing it right now so I can't decide if this is the right color for me or not I feel like it's a little bit too warm but I don't know let me know in the comments so I'm kind of contemplating sending his back but I really like the formula off and is easy to use sculpting my brow just as good as mine on the Saucy eyebrow Pomade but this looks a little bit more natural which I like and was like I was going for but I just don't know if the shade is right for me so I might be giving this back to get milk makeupLakebridge oh you know what I mean I forget the exact name of it but I know they have a shade that fits my eyebrow color very well cuz they just came out with a bunch of Shades but I wish they had more kids in this I do really like it
