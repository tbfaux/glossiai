jadyn_rose1220 reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so I've got a final I look here and what are used for this was the glossier lidstar in the tub and totally loved it very like a beautiful Rich color and applied really well it's got the best reviews for being long-lasting so that's great and then I use Pixi by Petra fairy lights and like the crystal white shade I thought I was going to be more of a shimmer but it was actually like a glitter you can see I like on my LEDs more like a glittery color that's okay though you know I'll roll with it and I think it's awesome applied well they were long lasting a lot of fun to do for the lashes I used some Adele wispy lashes and your mascara really quick I use the Lash Paradise by L'Oreal thank you for watching
