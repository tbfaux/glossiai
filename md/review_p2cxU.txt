isabelm reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey guys and today I'm doing the glossy a boy brow eyebrow Gel review and let me just tell you I am absolutely in love with this product I use everyday normally I will just use a pencil to bring out my ends a little bit just so that it frames by face better but other than that this is the only product I use on my eyebrows and it is absolutely incredible let me tell you my eyebrows are normally very not very fold when I put this on their looks so much more. And they have at least three or four colors in this product which is nice because you don't have to find Forever trying to find your perfect color its it goes pretty much with any hair color so if you are looking for a gray eyebrow gel this is it it's perfect is great and it's at a great price point so I highly recommend it
