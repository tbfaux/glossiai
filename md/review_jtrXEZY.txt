FootprintsbyDianna reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: this is a classy a prototype felt eyeliner in black as you can see the end is just so amazing it is fine heavily pigmented doesn't run once it's dried and does a great job and helping create a very fine too thick can I I love this product I'm going to keep using it and when it runs out I'm going to grab another it's a stable for every day
