makeupyourmind_girl reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey guys I have the glossier stretch concealer in the shade G11 and I absolutely love it I think I could go a little bit later for my skin tone but I like to apply here in a little bit this way here a little bit this way at the tops of my eyelids when I blend that all in I get a nice seamless coverage it's very sheer but you can build it up and then I said it I'm all set to go for my hot summer months I definitely recommend it
