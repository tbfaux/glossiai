dancer2007 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys today I'll be reviewing my other bomb.com by glossy a this one is birthday cake flavor and it is their special edition also something I did not say in my other video is that they do start wake peeling like the packaging which is pretty once you first get it though also something I didn't mention is it does not come with a lot in it so I was just maybe four or five times and there's like nothing left ya again this product did turn into liquid after one or two months and did not work well for my lips this product is not sent it at all and is just like a fake Vaseline that smells like very cake cake batter this one is actually my least favorite compared to the Rose and I definitely do not recommend this at all so other glasses things are good does not their bum. Khan's bad guys
