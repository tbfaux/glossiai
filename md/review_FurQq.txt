Ellisedp reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hi guys it's Elise and say when a review glossier's lip gloss pretty Infamous I think well-known I feel like everyone has seen the packaging at this point all over Instagram and everything I have in the shade clear but they just came out the holographic one and a red one here we go and kind of see what it does their outfit on somewhere else right now kind of hard to see cuz it is clear my only complaint is that is really sticky I've noticed is a lot at first it starts out great and really glossy and bigger pictures but then after awhile it just so sick of you in my opinion but a couple pictures it's trendy I don't know either of you with the Kylie Jenner lip gloss might like that better has a better side I think it does but it's cool to trans do what you want me to the holographic one that's nice
