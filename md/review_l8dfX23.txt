nikkigarcia21 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: I super great so I don't know if you tell but I've been I want I want a little crazy on Black Friday my guitar package just came in the mail and I'm going to review all of the bomb.com so sorry that it's been a couple days I got pretty busy but I'm going to kind of show you the sense flavors that I got so I love the packaging of anything with glossy aim I got the Cherry one Domingo one in the mint 19. The trio pack just cuz it was like I think it was like almost $10 cheaper so I thought it was definitely worth it so I'm going to go and make separate reviews for each one I'm going to start with the mint ones and the Cherry one in the mango one and then I'm going to try them on so you on my hand talk about the fence so that I get a more detailed review for each of them
