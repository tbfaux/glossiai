land_of_han reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay if I use glossier cloud paint every single day no exceptions today I am wearing their lightest pink color which is Puff although my cheekbone I focus mostly on my cheeks and here are my nose just cuz I like a girl Vibe I never have any problem with blending it is beautifully with all Foundation that I used they might using any foundation is so gorgeously it looks like a fresh natural but I love it
