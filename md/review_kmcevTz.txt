zameena reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: glossier lash slick is one of my favorite mascaras I've got it on these on these lashes I don't have it on these lashes and as you can see I do have long lashes will but they kind of wash out with that blook eyeliner so let's give these gals a little coat of lash look I love how small the bristles are cuz it means that'll help my lashes separate and how far more precise coding as opposed to just like globbing on the mascara that's one quotes and this is two cups kind of giving me 13 Going on 30 vibes
