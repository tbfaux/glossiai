ellessentially_ reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: next up a boy brown brown I have fallen out of love with this I think I used to be just I used to go so hard for boy brow blonde eyebrows looking a little chunky but honestly it doesn't have as much as cold as I want I think that's the biggest thing for me cuz I do have brown hairs you know they're there and I really want them to stay in place most of the time like I can fill them in with a pencil that's fine I really want the same place I do remember really liking the Kush brow from milk makeup anyways that's boy brow goes on easy feels a little wet on the ground until it says fine I wish I had more hold
