hannahroselund reviews Wowder by Glossier: okay this is my last review today I promise I just got this vehicle it is his a'gaci a louder it's like just a loose setting powder and I already I really do like it every one side of the packaging wasn't great but I feel like for most who's powders it's not like I think this is a really good idea to have a question cuz it keeps all the powder inside I think the design is so cute and I find it really does like I have my skin has to be greasy but even when it's not I'll still look shiny so she my forehead so this really just tone sound shine and yeah it's really comfortable it doesn't feel like I'm going powder at all they just feels really natural enlightened yeah I really like it
