asenciosol reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is a Swatch on how does looks like on my skin tone my face is a little bit wider than me but you can still see the different special you right now right before the light changes it is such a beautiful color it looks it looks like I got a little tiny bit of sun but it looks so sweet it such a natural glow all right my last $0.02 what I would say about dust is that honestly if you're a little bit darker than me you won't be able to see it cuz with me you can but I'm not just just keep that in mind
