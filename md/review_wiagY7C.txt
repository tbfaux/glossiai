butterandbeauty reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey guys so this is the man you said it's very reflective I was like that meta this is what glossy a stretch concealer and I'm going to show you why it's my favorite so I really like obviously this looks new since I just got it so I can't wait to show you but like this is just from one swipe across is really soft and blendable so and show you the rest on my face so this is just the amount I took with like once swab or one swipe of my finger and I did a little bit low there I am a very pale person so this I use the jeep with a shade g12 I think you can see I'm going to do the last bit off camera so I can show you the final product so this is my favorite because I don't like concealer to be too thick if you need like see it Blends out really well if you need a thicker one this isn't it but I love it
