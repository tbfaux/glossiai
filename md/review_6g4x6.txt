mollymoro reviews Generation G by Glossier: hey guys say I'm going to be reviewing the glossier generation G lipstick also the reason why I have two different eye looks on his cuz I just reviewed the lid stars from LA CA Sushi go check out the shade that I have is like and I really like it but really though this lipstick it's not drying it shows up but it doesn't like staying other things like going to think I don't know it's like a tinted chapstick but better so am I handsome looks like this it's a really pretty pink color when you apply it it is kind of dry like it doesn't glide on so if that bothers you and I'm sorry
