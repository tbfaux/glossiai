amyelle reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: this is the glossier skin tint I have it in the shade G9 I believe I love this this is my go-to chewy fresh face looking tinted face like older one I'll put some on my hands are kind of rub myself but there's some left and I didn't even see but it just smoothing out your complexion without looking heavy without looking cakey price-wise I think it's okay I wish clothes a would lower the price is a little bit and the bus was quite small compared to if you see my hand compared to my hand goes amazingly with stretch concealer I just love it so I would definitely recommend it
