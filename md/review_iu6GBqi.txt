Jiannaestioko reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys okay so I'm going to be reviewing the glossy a birthday bomb.com that everybody knows and loves so when you use it Family Nails ideas but I'm just show you I thought okay so I think it's good but I don't think it's very hydrating at all are moisturizing and anyway I think it's just pretty like and it smells good has like a little bit of like sparkle and a little bit of a tent but other than that if you're looking for like a hydrating lip balm I wouldn't say go for this but I still like it and I recommend it if you want something like prettier and like this again it smells really good like I want to like it just smells like it so I would say get it but it is also pricey so it's up to you
