tru_beauty reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: part 5 part 5 of wet dog hair I'm so tired but not really so priming moisturizer Rich so psyched about this product I just got in the mail this week. Smells amazing like kind of like a perfume a chai latte almost home what kind of looks like a chai latte in a way it's cuz. Like I don't even know it's like a light a very light color riche is definitely the term to describe it because it it's it's very rich stick and it's not like leaky or watery and it does wonders for my skin overnight I'm kind of sad I didn't get it sooner in the winter when my skin is really like facing a lot of drying but yeah I just put this on my face at night after my serums and my skin is just velvety goodness in the morning
