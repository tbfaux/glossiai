tialaurynn reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: Degrassi a cloud paint so I have this in the color of beam what I really love about this blush is that is a liquid blush and I've never felt like I did really well with the powder blush so when I got this it was definitely a life-changer for me but I love is that it gives it like that subtle Rosie looks down it's not too much for me and I feel like this is goes really good with my skin tone and I love that they have different shades for every and all type of skin tone when you put it on you just squeeze a little bit onto your fingers and then you just put it on your teeth little bit and then massage it into your skin like that but that's what I do so it's a great thing to have if you're one of those people who do I make a routine that's quick and easy and is good for on-the-go and if you ever need to freshen up your cheeks
