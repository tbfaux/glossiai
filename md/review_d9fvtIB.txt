lilyytay reviews Hand Cream by Glossier: this is the new glossy hand cream which came out last month I think I wasn't sure if I was going to splurge on this cuz it is a little bit more pricey for a body care item but I'm so glad that I got this cuz it smells incredible the packaging is adorable it looks kind of like a little lighter and I'm obsessed it's like soft touch and easy to squeeze out and the scent is supposed to be lost a you reimagined which it definitely is it gives me glasya you Vibes but it also smells very fresh instead of Muskie which I'm a big fan of the actual hand cream formula is super nice it doesn't feel greasy on the skin at all and it absorbs really nicely into the skin without leaving a layer of any stickiness and it also feels very hydrating
