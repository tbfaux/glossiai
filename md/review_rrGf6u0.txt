vidadeleah reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: okay so by now you may know the brand classy a one of my favorite products from this brand is the lip gloss actually like all the cliches I mean of course I could go out to eat but I think you can expect that with any place but I do like the we're on it I do feel like it's light and it gives a really nice glossy look when you wear it okay so here are the swatches on the top we have holographic right in the middle and then declare on the bottom you can see even right now like that beautiful Sheen they all have but that nice holographic one has a bit of that pink Shimmer and the bride has a pretty red tent and then Clara causes of a classic look
