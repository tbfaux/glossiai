hmwright02 reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: interview with the glossier stretch concealer I have mine in medium so easily become one of my favorite everyday concealers at first I didn't think that I like the amount of covered it has because it doesn't have a full covered by any means but if you put it on and kind of let it sit for a minute and then Blended out there's much more coverage also using a brush helps a lot with the coverage and for an everyday I don't like a huge full coverage look
