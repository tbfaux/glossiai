emilymak reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hey Isis for my makeup look today that I did for the water be five minute face challenge I use the glossier lip gloss when's the one that's clear on my lips and I put the child like an hour ago so it's kind of like gone now but I really like this the consistency is amazing the doe foot applicator is super soft and it is so glossy and it looks so nice. I literally use my phone in thereand it feels so good it's not sticky to the point where I like to touch it what if you touch is going to stick but like it's not super sticky but it's also like not not sticky at all so take a little bit sticky but like the right amount of sticky and it's also really moisturizing and and also the packaging on all Aussie products are so aesthetic
