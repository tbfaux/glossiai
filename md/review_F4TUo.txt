weird_bronwyn reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys welcome back to my reviews for today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier balm.com because it's amazing so the one I'm currently holding is the mint although I have tried every single flavor except the coconut I just think this is a 10 attend lip salve you can use it on other parts of your body like cuticles and elbows I person ever tried a double new used on my lips and I think it's just so great it's amazing for the winter I just feel like it leaves your lips moisturize 4 hours and despite the fact that it's $12 and they're really expensive I do think it's worth the price I really think it's worth it though if you get thebundle of like three of them because that it only ends up being 10 for tube and these last few really long time to 10 out of 10 recommend
