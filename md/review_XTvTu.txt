amberboulder reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: Gabriel talking about glasses lip gloss so I've been on the market for a good luck cost for a really long time I tried a lot of like drugstore ones and I was really excited to find this one buy coffee game so have nice dough tip applicator that makes it super easy to apply I'm just like a lot of glossier products it's really buildable so you start off with the space level shines I can do one more thing it is super shiny I just like any lip gloss it's really sticky when him and put it on and then I eat right afterwards and I end up like with a crumb stuck to my lips the entire time I'm sure if you have long hair and stick to it I don't have that problem and honestly it's a it's a fairly long lasting obviously to lip gloss you should reapply it but it doesn't like get chalky or smudge a lot because it is clear so we can get a more subtle shine
