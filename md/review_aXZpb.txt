_emilymarie reviews Super Pure by Glossier: so my favorite Serum at the moment is glossier super pure which is the perfect thing to pair with solution this is niacinamide and zinc so it really helps to calm your breakouts and deal with redness and all that it's super easy you need like the tiniest drop Spider-Man super lightweight and it actually helps as I break out so much and again another reason why I love glossy a it's not very expensive I've had this for a pretty long time now and it's only half an ounce but I stopped and got through to have like half left I feel like I use it everyday so you're definitely getting your money's worth when you buy this product
