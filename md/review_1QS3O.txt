vegamfrancine reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: today I'm going to use the glossier stretch concealer I'm using the shade medium and so I think I could get away with like right now but this is the only one I have so yeah it's a very creamy deviant ecchi formula but I really like it and I like to use a brush to blend it in and it won't add a lot of coverage but I like that my skin still looks like like skin so oh yeah
