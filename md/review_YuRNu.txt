emmykay reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so I guess I'll go ahead and repeat The Last Ship as well even though I'm sure there's probably a thousand reviews of this on here but one of the best mascaras I've ever used a really cute package and it's $16 on the master I used before this was like 35 so I think this is super reasonably priced it's definitely a must-have for me
