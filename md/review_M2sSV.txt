Franthebee reviews Colorslide by Glossier: once again I'm back with another of you and this time I will be reviewing be glossy a color slide in hardcore velvet so first off I like this I pencil because it's really pigmented and it's really smooth and easy to apply the cons of this I pencil is that it's not really smudge-proof I get pretty oily eyelids and so the color did kind of transfer to the bottom part of my eye and I noticed that if I even like slightly touch my ID rub off so it doesn't really last super long for me but it wasn't anything like drastic but it does transfer for me and if you have oily eyelids oily skin it's likely to transfer other than that it's a nice product but I probably will not be rehearsing just because it is a little pricey
