legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Glossier Cloud Paint A new way to blush (DUSK) by Glossier: hey Spirits I'm in the middle of doing my makeup for the day and I just tried out this sample of glasses Cloud paint in the shade dusk so I was really surprised cuz I was expecting based on this that this color is going to be kind of a peachy color peachy color more like a pink you like a very stereotypical pink blush and it turned out to be more like a light brown color like I have it on my cheeks already like it was an extremely neutral blush which I actually prefer more than the pink so I was you know what happily surprised but I just feel like that's really not what I was expecting based on this thing it's a really pretty color though if you're someone who doesn't like the stereotypical paint blushes like me yeah so like I've been just trying to decide if I want to get a second Shay to call pain because I have gone so I honestly might get this this looks pretty nice
