corsets_and_crewnecks reviews Lidstar by Glossier: today I'm going to tell you all about my favorite I tent the glossier lidstar these are my three favorite Shades from the collection and they also look really great with my blue eyes this one is the inner Corner shade that I used I use this off and on my whole lid and it has Perry legally blue sparkles in it so it looks really cool and when I have winged eyeliner on I use this to smoke it out to make it more shimmery and subtle looking so these dry down really really fast I would say you should use fingers to blend instead of brushes and also I would use lots of layers they're pretty sheer especially the lighter shade so I would lay air layer layer until you can really really see the color they're perfect for everyday wear and because they're shaped like this they're very easy to store in your bag or purse
