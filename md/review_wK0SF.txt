nikkimalia reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: I'm going to be reviewing the glossier Milky jelly cleanser conditioning face wash so I still have some makeup on and I like to start off by letting my face a little bit the product doesn't sud so if you're looking for something that does said this is not for you it also smells really Rosie it is a gentle cleanser that leaves my skin feeling baby soft and glowy
