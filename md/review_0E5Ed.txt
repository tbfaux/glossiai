Bmak0324 reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hi guys so I'm going to go through my nightly skincare routine and I will be reviewing each product that I used tonight and these are usually the products that I use every night including glossier's cult classic milky jelly cleanser honestly there's probably a million or views are there on this boat I'm going to give you another one this stuff is amazing I do not have sensitive skin I will start off by saying that my skin is Pretty Tough when it comes to intense ingredients but that is not what this is this is literally so lightweight it doesn't foam up it doesn't strip your skin it doesn't make your skin feel dry my skin literally feels so moist rise after using his appeal like literally moisturizer on your face that's cleansing it gets off all your makeup and I just cannot recommend it enough it's everything I want in a cleanser
