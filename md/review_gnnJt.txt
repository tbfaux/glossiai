vegamfrancine reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: okay so my nose looks huge with this lighting but we're going to go with it and I'm probably the last person to review the last name Aquila cancer but this is the class where I use basically every night whether I'm wearing makeup or not if I wear makeup I use it as a second chance because I don't think it does the best at removing eye makeup and mascara but it's pretty good still and it leaves my face feeling very soft and I love that is that it has Rose in it and give cancer I think you get a good amount of product and it's one of my less CA favorites
