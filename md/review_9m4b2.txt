han reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so glossier Cloud paint took me a little bit of time to get used to because I don't usually wear blush because I'm not good at it I put too much on they say that you can't mess with this one out but there was a lot of trial-and-error with me trying to perfect using Cloud paint so what I've managed to do is I just kind of squeeze a little bit tap it on my finger and then tapping on it's actually very easy to use if you're good at anything at all the colors are amazing it stays on very well it doesn't feel like you have anything on 10 out of 10 would recommend I very glad I learn how to use it because I really like it
