Michellediaz reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: glossier lip gloss now this is such a get the class I would braid it at 4.5 out of 5 because yes it is very clear that very pretty. I did get a little foggy though I can't see it very well but it is good it's a little over price but I mean it's very good if you're willing to buy it and it's slightly gummy but like it is a good lip gloss and I would recommend a pirate
