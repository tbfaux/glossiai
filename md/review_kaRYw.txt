hellojewlie reviews Generation G by Glossier: today I'm going to be reviewing the brand new packaging for glossier Generation G this is the shade light is also a slightly new formula is still the same at matte finish that you love like a semi matte finish attic lights on so much smoother and it's slightly more sheer but still really buildable as you can see the old packaging just wasn't built to last it this one's got cracks all over it if you can hear it but the tube of lipstick is actually loosen here which is not convenient at all the idea behind Genji is that it's like so easy to apply you don't really need a mirror because the formula is so great it just gives you that plotted look left but you couldn't just throw these in your bag and go because they were just get destroyed so the new packaging is so much more substantial it sticker shaped more like a traditional lipstick and the cap is so secure I can't even open it with one handhere's the shade like which is my favorite shade and it's super protected in this metal tube and ready to go
