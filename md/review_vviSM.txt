curlyn reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so I have the agua today with star in the shade called Next feelings about this I like don't hate it but like I don't like it either it's kind of like one of those products where I'm not really sure how I feel about it I love the color of it but then I find that like when I start to like Blended out like it just like kind of like dissipates and like the color is not as vibrant and it's super oily on your eyelid like you have really oily eyelids I honestly don't recommend this cuz it's going to Kris and like all around your face but I don't know why created some really great looks with this but it's also like I don't know I just find it's not practical and it doesn't work as good as like the Stila eye glitter is so
