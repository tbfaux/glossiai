madierb reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so I have these glossier's Cloud Paint & puff which is a light pink so you think you can tell I didn't publish here but I did put it here and it just gives you a nice I think flash like it looks like a natural blush it's really easy to blend and it's buildable I just put on the right side to it's super easy to bond with your fingers which I love because I feel like when you use your fingers it just looks more natural and like when something is hard to bond with your finger is like kind of annoying I'm definitely going to try more shade so it doesn't recommend this place is really good for beginners also I'm always loving things for beginners like I'm still beginner so yeah I highly recommend this also is just a cute little like paint tubes so yeah
