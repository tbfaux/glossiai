tangomango reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: heroin so I can't remember the username but someone asked me to do a video on the bomb.com that's also asked to do a video on the body scrub from Frank body which I'll be using like either today or tomorrow and I'll have a review for that as well but I'm just telling you all the color and the scent and I call that of the bomb.com than what I think it smells like a my which ones I would recommend in like all that so I have all the flavors except for the unscented and the Cherry one 5 tides of cherry one because my mom has it so I'll still be sharing my thoughts on that but I have never tried the unscented but just a unscented on colored ones with pretty generic and like just one part but a lot of people do to these are just over price colored scented Vaseline the person I really don't agree with that because I actually you don't like I don't like passing like at all like it's not moisturizing at all I don't know if that's just like me or something but these do work really well and I'm running now
