butterandbeauty reviews Super Pure by Glossier: this is the glossier super pure serum so it has many active ingredients are niacinamide and zinc to help keep skin clear reduce redness or prevent it as you can see this is why I love since I'm almost done with it this is my second bottle I have another niacinamide serum that I received recently so I won't be purchasing this immediately when this runs out but I think it's a great piece of serums rooms are kind of I think in my opinion what you should invest your money and more since they're harder to make so for $28 yeah it's it's a bit of us the expense you know for a small thing but you only need a few drops and it last a good while and I think it's very effective serum so yeah in my opinion this my favorite was the 3 supers and I hate is by far the best for anyone who's trying to figure 2
