fourteencarrot reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: okay I finished another this is the glossy a bubble wrap lip and eye cream I use this every day as my eye cream under makeup I think it's great under makeup it's soaks right if I do give a second but I've never had a problem with my eye makeup moving at all I typically wear powder eyeshadow don't know if that matters but I really like it I will be reproducing this I do like this product a lot I think it is a great intro to eye cream it doesn't have any active but it's super moisturizing and I think just helps plump the skin so we'll be reproducing this one
