missylissy reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys so here has a milk makeup lip and cheek tint in the shade work and this actually got for my birthday reward it came with a little mascara I haven't tried it out yet but I'm going to try for the first time on camera for you guys so have an interesting smell it kind of smells citrusy which is nice and refreshing my blush of choice is usually the glossier cloud paint so this kind of similar it's a little more creamier I'm assuming I'm just going to go straight onto my cheeks my do I boil a skin so let me know cream blushes or not my go-to but they're nice natural look this is what it looks like when did I put a little on my nose to you can't really tell to blend you have to press a little hard but I think it looks really nice and
