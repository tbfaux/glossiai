zameena reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: this is a glossy liquid eyeliner in their black shade I think they only have one shade right now but here's a tip it's got a brush tip I love how quickly the pigment or what you call this ink eyeliner ink comes out of the bottle I am also realizing that I'm using my phone as a mirror and I used to do that a lot when I was in like my early twenties and ubering everywhere those late to everything and I love how you can really precisely control is tip and this is my ring with the glossy eyeliner I love
