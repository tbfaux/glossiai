ayannaslife reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: hi guys I'm going to be doing a very very honest review on the glass evora first of all the packaging is really cute so I do like that but honestly the product is pretty useless and monster kind of smells weird when you squirt it out and not that much comes out which is I do like that about it when you put it on like under your eyes and on your lips it doesn't do anything so I would not recommend this product
