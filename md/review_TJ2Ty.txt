bellagroth reviews Lidstar by Glossier: now this is the glossier lidstar I have it in Moon and cub and I love nice things as I'm almost out of them now I would highly recommend these products and all the colors they have a really good shade range if you're going for a natural look you can just simply put it on your eyelid and blend it out and it will give in nice glittery left but if you want a more advanced you can put eyeshadow underneath and you can build it on top to give it a nice glittery and dewy finish I love this product and went throughout the day it will fall or the glitter will fall onto below your like Chiefs and we'll just give your skin and even more dewy look and so we look I love these products I love the consistency I love the packaging it's super cute an aesthetically pleasing and I would highly recommend them
