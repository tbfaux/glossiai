sarah_novio reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: Sandra viewing glass who plays glitter jelly in glass Bonsai that is a million times that I'm wearing on top of my liner and also on the inner corner so they say you can dip your finger in and use it to Devin on which I did on the inner corner or you can use spatula that it comes with or sold separately I like this color because it's lightweight and has a lot of dimension in the color
