zameena reviews Colorslide by Glossier: so these are the glass yay play color slide eye pencils I've got the shade fuzz Club on my eyelids already and then this other blue is called hardcore velvet want to share how creamy these are unfortunately glossy play was discontinued but it seems like they have plans to do something else with their color cosmetics adding a little outline at the end see how easy that was and saw like these aren't super sharpened but the ship came out really cute I think that these were ahead of their time in the sunset at your everyday Instagram crawl was not using crazy colors just a couple of years ago but I honestly I'm happy that I kept them looks pretty fun
