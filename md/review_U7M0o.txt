sona reviews Generation G by Glossier: everyone today I wanted to review for you the last see a generation G lipstick in the shade Leo now when I was ordering this what I wanted was a deep Brown because I've been straying away from reds and I looking more for a neutral Browns and I found that bite bite lipsticks I don't know if that's the name I think bite Beauty they have a really good one in the sheet try and I wanted something like this but a little darker so this is what it looks like on my lips and this is what it looks like on my handit's very drying it does not dry your lips but it's a very dry formula not sticky at all a transfers it transfers a little bit but not too much I really comfortable to where I found that I can wear Chopstick over this very easily so so far I really like it
