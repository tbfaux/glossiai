mads__jean reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hey guys so I will be doing a review on the glossy lip gloss if you just on my last video I just went to the Austin pop up and it was like cute if it's just really hot in there but no yeah so I've been wearing this non-stop since I got it literally like the best boss ever like where am I turn it on but like look look at it it's just like literally so flattering it's not like sticky or anything at all obviously like your hair sticks to it but like that's what every lost does but like the gloss your boss is all I have to say
