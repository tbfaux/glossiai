dewyinthedesert reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: guys I'm back with another glossy review this time it is for the priming moisturizer this isn't the packaging looks like has their cute little pink signature if I really loved the first aid Beauty smoothie priming moisturizer but I'm always looking for like a glowy base kind of priming product so I thought I would give this one from gasia try I've been really liking it so far it hasn't made me break out or anything like that it's nice and hydrating just to put over my sunscreen and my moisturizer and things like that it is really nice and I feel like it doesn't make my makeup break up or anything like that it is white but I feel like it rubs into the skin really nicely so I'm going to show you what it looks like I might and it looks like I don't know that it prolongs the longevity of my makeup but it definitely makes me feel really hydrated
