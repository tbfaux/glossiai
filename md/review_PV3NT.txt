han reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: I'm going to talk about the glasses that stick so first of all the packaging it's really cute the way that it comes out of the bottle with like the little rollerball that's really cool but it did not work for me this is a big red dry blister I didn't spot test it before I put it on my skin and I mean this it's are gone but I have dry red blisters but my little sister is 14 and she has like that teenage acne and it works really well for her so it's definitely a product you would need to spot test on some part of your skin before you put it on your whole face not saying it's a bad product it just didn't work from me but like it works for my sister so give it a try I mean it's still really cool
