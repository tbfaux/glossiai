zameena reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: glossier Mega greens Galaxy Pack this is a detoxifying face mask made with kaolin Clay it is meant to draw out excess oil from your face if you have oily skin I have normal to dry skin but I do find that this masks helps my skin feel a little bit tighter it is meant to decrease the visibility of pores I don't notice that because I don't have huge pores but my skin definitely feel clear it doesn't feel dry when I'm done using it in fact that feels moisturized afterward as a little tingly feeling and as you can see these little like raised texture pieces I think that's meant to exfoliate the face once you're done and it Wi-Fi wash it off really easily I love the stuff
