hannahroselund reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: okay so I just got this concealer yesterday from glassy it's distressing teether in medium and I'm already obsessed with it I have never really pop containers before money ever used like drugstore wand concealers and this I'm just obsessed it's so smooth so silky so like a creamy and it's just a really nice formula I look like a gremlin but I really do like this a lot of people did say before I bought it that it would be a lot easier than most but I personally like that like I don't do heavy makeup so this just give you like the perfect amount of coverage at home once I got them answer so you just got a little bit on your finger and I just find it covers everything I need covering
