skinisspooky reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: Caleb so I'm going to do a first impression on the glassies at stake which is a reward that I got from this at first of all I want to talk about the packaging because it's so cute and like industrial it has like a little gear on the top but glossy is always super good with their packaging and also its functional so the way that you apply the product if you twist the bottom here and then it comes out the top and you apply at like a roller ball onto the area that you want to apply it and the applicator itself it's actually antibacterial so you don't need to worry about it getting gross when you've been like touching it to your pimples and stuff so this is marketed as a break first time last night on a hormonal pimple that I got and I didn't really notice a difference after one application but I did notice that I did not irritate my skin or make me really dry but I did take the precaution of applying this over oil because I have very sensitive skin
