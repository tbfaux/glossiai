bodybeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: I saw it opened it and then I realize that I probably too hard on the container and it is cracked yay but anyways this is the part I believe Amazonian and I want to flip it over Amazonian clay 12-hour blush in part A so I just have it on this side and as you could see it's a really pretty dusty rose and I like it cuz it gives you that like sort of sunburn look that's why I love this one and it cracks and I'm kind of sad butit gives you that Dusty pinky Rosie rides that I love of course since it is a powder it's not like the glossier cloud paint where it's like service dewy glow is more of a matte finish which I'm not mad about because I can always go over it with a little bit of highlight also love that blush on the eyes if I want a cute Pinkie Shadow even though it's cracked and sore
