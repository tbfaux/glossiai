makenayee reviews Futuredew by Glossier: the next product I'm going to review is a'gaci a feature do oil serum hybrid I don't know how I feel about this mostly because I have oily skin to begin with and I should have known that before I purchase this a lot of people like it because it gives you a duie fast before your foundation or you can wear it by yourself I wasn't expecting it to be like I want to say tinted but it's definitely not clear or transparent when you squirt it out of the bottle and it does make your face really do we but I'm pretty or ugly around my T-Zone area so this I probably applied to my cheeks or something but my first impression is that it's not really my favorite I don't really like this fragrance of it either and it's just really really heavy on my skin
