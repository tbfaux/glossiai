missylissy reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys so did I have an appointment which means that I don't really want to wear that much makeup I'm just going to keep it natural I wear make-up everyday this week and I just am not feeling up to it today but I am going to be wearing my bomb.com I just recently got this very one I also have the mango and the birthday cake one I do think this one is my favorite though I love that it gives you a subtle 10th I think that's what makes it my favorite so this is actually a lot thicker than I thought which is not a bad thing it takes a little effort to squeeze it out and it's this very dark shade but it doesn't show that dark obviously when you've landed on your lipsthis just smells amazing and the tint is so pretty I think that it will work on a lot of different skin tones and it just going to look beautiful for the fall I think this is a great product for a pretty good price I got the set of 3 which made it only $10 each and I recommend trying it out if you haven't yet
