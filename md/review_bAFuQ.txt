AndreaIslas reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so I finally got the time to review the glossier cloud paint in the shade storm it is amazing I think you guys know you just need this much not much and just dab it on your cheeks you can also use it in your eyelids a little bit in your lips a little bit in the top of my nose little bit and it gives you a very natural look and very cute I mean and it's very lightweight and it's buildable and it goes a really long way with us so it's a Coke Classic everyone should try it once in a while and you say yes for me you know
