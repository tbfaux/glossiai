butterandbeauty reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so car to like with the first one I wipe off about half to two-thirds of the product because I find it goes on too heavily most of the time unless it's so clear shade I have this to be clear I have this issue has most proud gels so it's not that much of a criticism but I really I've always loved Boy bar like I said I believe this is like 16 or $18 almost but I really like that kind of you know Fuller texture look into this is one this is more polished just a little bit more natural but I just love it either way so yeah this is now finally in my makeup bag forever highly recommend for redheads just use this as you need to like take off
