glowingandgrowing reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys 2lb give you guys some tips on how to use glossier's Infamous Cloud paint so today I have the color being in front of me and this is just a soft Peach I think it's a really great color because it complements a lot of skin tones with a variety of undertones when you first open your Cloud paint you're going to see a little bit of foil packaging I recommend that you use a needle or a sewing pin to poke a little hole just so that's easier to squeeze the process products out because it comes out really fast this is helps to control how much product you can get because a little bit goes a long way if too much comes out feel free to stick it in the cab so you can use another time the product is still perfectly fine and you want to use every last drop because this stuff is really amazing
