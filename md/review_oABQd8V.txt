anabanana000 reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so this is the glossier cloud paint in puff really don't like this I have to say I know a lot of people like that I know this might be a very controversial but I don't like the consistency it makes it it's like way too tinted like and not like liquidy enough so it makes it look very unnatural like I like it to look natural and I like I have this milk thing that literally does the same thing I like it a lot more and I can also put on my website I'm kind of disappointed galago
