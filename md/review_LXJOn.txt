martinabh reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: glossier lash slick mascara is actually one of the products I didn't expect to like at all I'm pretty picky about mascara and I fell in love with this one as soon as I tried that the brush is really nice because the bristles are really small which really helps separate your lashes and it's water-resistant so well it's not waterproof it definitely holds up throughout the day this morning and it's been almost 12 hours and still looks really really good because of the brush it really helps separate and lengthen your lashes and they don't look clumpy and they look extra long and I love how naturally lookit's also one of the few mascaras that doesn't make my under eyes might want to use it on my bottom lashes because is water resistant and it doesn't get all over your face which is really important and the only now. Had to do that this is my third tube and I absolutely love it
