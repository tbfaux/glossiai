dewyinthedesert reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys I wanted to talk a little bit about the blush I have on today it is glossier cloud paint in the shade dusk first I want to talk to a little bit about the packaging so it comes in this little too I think it is so cute and I love it but sometimes a little bit more product comes out then I wish it would so I would just be aware of that if you are going to purchase but the formula itself is amazing it is a brush I have on right now and I love them they are really great and I think I need to pick up a couple more shades it Blends seamlessly over powder products and cream products the color Blends out really well I don't find that I have it Apache or anything like that it also doubles as like a lip tint although right now I have the Jin jeon I have used it as kind of an all-over monochromatic look and they are just amazing I can't recommend them enough it is one of the best cream blush formulas
