thekristynedit reviews Generation G by Glossier: the glossy agency lipstick in the shade cake is the perfect peachy Brown nude lipstick is so stunning I love the color so much it's just a beautiful natural peachy brownie nude it is definitely a lot lighter than Leo which is elliptic I've already reviewed but I like this a lot I don't think that this is like I don't think that you need to go out and purchase this shade just because it's not very unique and like I've said before the formula doesn't last too long and this isn't a shade that'll leave a stain but I do really like the color and if you want to splurge on a little tiny to that I would totally pick it up but yeah I really do love this shade I like Leo a little bit more for my skin tone but if you're very pale I think this would be a perfect peachy nude for you and yeah so I don't know pick it up if you want or don't doesn't really matter
