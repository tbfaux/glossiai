amendoza98 reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: this is my second bottle of glossier priming moisturizer I never really liked how my primer felt so heavy on my skin and made my makeup look so cakey and this is a great alternative to that while leaving me looking a duie hydrated and not screwing up my makeup so all you need is just a little bit cuz it goes on I sent then and I even use this when I'm not wearing makeup just to give me a really dewy finish look and it also has some retinol in it so it tightens your pores I think it's retinol not entirely sure but it doesn't make my skin hurt or it doesn't make me a sun sensitive and I make sure to always wear sunscreen under it but it just leaves you looking really nice and hydrated and dewy like you just got out of the shower
