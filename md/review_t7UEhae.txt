vanzillascott reviews Skywash by Glossier: I have two of the new glasses guy wash a matte liquid eyeshadows and Sable just did a piece on it where she basically tried all of the shades and spoke really honestly about the products and just what she thinks about the quality and how pigmented it is so I'm just going to show you guys what it looks like so this is what it looks like when I've literally like three layers of this product I really packed it on as you can see it's really share so we're staying true to like glossier's hold no makeup makeup look but I do think it's a little bit patchy I think the formula could be better so this is the blue shade and I'm just going to go ahead and say I like those eyes better
