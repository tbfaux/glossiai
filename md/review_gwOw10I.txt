hannahbeauty reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so this is the product that I was really excited to try it's been on my wish list for a long time and I picked it up during the glossy a friends and family sale so this is their lash slick mascara and their iconic pink packaging and as with a lot of their beauty products be marking in around it is kind of it's like you but better so your lashes but better which is a very different way to Market a mascara compared with a lot of the really kind of flashy flamboyant ads that we see so I think that this is a nice product I'm wearing it on my lashes right now so I'm not going to apply anymore and I guess I don't think I would repurchase this just because it is a little bit pricier than a drugstore mascara and for me I really like a mascara that will stay on my lashes but the moment it hits water is gone the Ilia mascara is like that and this it's not waterproof but it does take a little bit more elbow grease to remove
