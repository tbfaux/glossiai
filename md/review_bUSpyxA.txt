alleex reviews Wowder by Glossier: one of my everyday favorites is the glossier wowder which is in the shade G 11-2 g12 this is a loose setting powder and what I really like about this is that it keeps my makeup in place but it doesn't give me a very flat map dry finish I used it today to set the inner part of my cheeks as well as my Tea Zone and chin and as you can see my radiant finish Foundation is still looking really really nice and fresh and I don't see any kind of dryness or taking us anywhere and something really cool about this powder is instead of a regular sister it has this little net that helps you prevent yourself from picking up way too much product
