j-napz reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so this is dusk cuffs older sister and she is so excited to come out of this and she's out now so this is the color I was most excited for I was kind of like I kind of felt bad for puff but I literally couldn't wait to get this in the mail messed up a little bit so I thought this would be more of like a bronzer shade and it turns out that it's a little more peachy than I thought so it looks kind of weird under my cheeks but I really love the color Ivysaur watch right here it's really beautiful I just went the wrong way so consensus is cloud paint in dusk are not a bronzer but they're really nice thanks
