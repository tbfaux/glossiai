jessierose reviews Super Pure by Glossier: let's talk about Sarah right here I have the glossy a super pure which is a niacinamide zinc and B3 serum which are all acne fighting ingredients with prolonged and continued use of this product you will notice last redness and less acne must break out kind of things like glass but I don't think is that it will clear acne if you have it like if you have existing acne it's not going to clear that out it will help eat in the process of clearing your skin because you will not get more a $28 you get 0.5 fluid ounces which I think it's a little steep but for a serum to do what it says it's going to do is pretty remarkable and definitely worth the price keeps my skin pretty clear as you can see
