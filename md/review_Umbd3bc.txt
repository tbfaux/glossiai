zameena reviews Hand Cream by Glossier: glossier hand cream here is the packaging it is of course it's beautiful and it has a little open weird little design here you can easily control how much lotion comes out got a really pillowy soft powdery scent to it and a very powdery texture so it's not as quickly absorbing you can feel the texture of this on your hands afterward so like if you don't like the feeling of a lotion on your hands the means it's not for you but if you love the smell of glass are you this is for you I like it I love keeping on my desk for when I'm feeling a little dry I go to this
