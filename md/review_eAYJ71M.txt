alleex reviews Lidstar by Glossier: I am deep into a single eyeshadow phase right now and the one I'm wearing today is this one from glossy a this is the alleged star in the shade herb it is this gorgeous kind of grungy Mossy green with a slight gold reflect to it and I think it is so pretty I used it as my only eyeshadow today to do this really basic slightly hazy look and I just think it's beautiful I applied as with my fingertips and because this is quite a quick drying formula I like to work in light layers so I tap a very sheer amount all over my eyelid and then I focus a little bit more pigment closer to my lash line I really appreciate how long wearing this is because I have very oily hooded eyelids that don't work with all liquid Shadows but this one that stays put
