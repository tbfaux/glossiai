fourteencarrot reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: how gorgeous is this Orange this is the place you play vanilla clip and disco and it is the most amazing orange color is most like a tangerine definitely has a little bit of red in it I have three of these I love each color and I think I have another one on the way because the formula is super soft and comfortable it's shiny and I wore this product to a concert last night and I applied it a couple times and it feels like you're putting on a ChapStick or lip balm really comfortable you can put it on in the dark anyway I really do love this product I like the packaging with the the phone tip in the clicker but it did click a couple times in my purse at the show last night so that's an unintended consequence I'm sure but I love the Bass I Love The Branding this is definitely my favorite
