peneloqe reviews Lidstar by Glossier: today I'm doing a review on the glossier lidstar I have it in the shade Moon and it's just a nice they have other more tinted versions but I think this works best for me I love this product I'm wearing it right now it's not very noticeable in this lighting but it looks really great this is the applicator and it has the product right there you just type it on your eyelid and then with your finger you just blend it in also the packaging is very nice so I really recommend this product it's a great if you don't want for eyeshadow but you just want to Shimmer cuz that's what it is but they also have more tinted obvious version
