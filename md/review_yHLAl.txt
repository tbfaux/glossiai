chai reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: this is my favorite concealer of all time it's so light but it's the coverage is actually pretty good as you can see I don't have that much left but I've used it for a long time so this will definitely last you more than a few months it directly to my face and it's all Blended right now but you can see the difference already I also like a plan it on my nose because it's very red and also on my upper lip to hide any like little veins that's pretty much how I use this concealer I use I also used to play some pimples and it completely eliminates the redness not only that but it's also very natural-looking so it doesn't look like you're wearing makeup at all which is great I recommend it
