harmonym reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: all right so this as you can see is the glossier priming moisturizer but this one is the priming Moisturizer in Rich rather than their regular priming moisturizer so it's cute it's Minnie and that's because I received it in there skincare edit I believe is what it's called that had a bunch of mini sizes of their products and I think many types of perfect for this it's not something that I want to buy a full size of but it is something I'm happy to have around during the day my skin is kind of combo oily and so I don't normally use a super thick or occlusive moisturizer throughout the day however I do think this is really nice and it adds a rich yet lightweight moisture to your skin the thing that I dislike about it is you can smell the intense fragrance and the intense Rosemary essential oils and that's just not something I personally choose to incorporate a lot into my skincare routine but other than the fragrance I think this is an awesome
