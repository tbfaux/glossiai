skinisspooky reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys so I picked up the glossier lidstar in the color slip during their Black Friday sale and I've been testing it out since then so I have a pretty good opinion on it so the first time that I used this I took the applicator and I applied the product to my finger and then I use my finger to apply and I found that using this method there was really like no color whatsoever I might as well just been wearing nothing so I tried a different method and that's taking the applicator and applying it directly to my eyelid I'll show you guys okay so this is what it looks like it just looks like a little lip gloss. So what I would do is I put a bit on the side of it on this side and then I would use the applicator to spread it out on my eyelid pretty much like all the way you can blend it up pretty well and then I would just blend edges at the end with my fingersthe color that I got is just like a light wash of pink you can see it here I really like it
