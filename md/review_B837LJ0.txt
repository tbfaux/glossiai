swaggy_makeup reviews Cream Eye Shadow, Liquid Eye Shadow | Glossier by Glossier: triggers serious I did this on my last account but wanted to do it again cuz I have some other stuff that I didn't use we're going to start with the lids far I lost my lip gloss but I am hoping to buy a new one soon so be waiting for that anyways I'm so the product this is a cream eyeshadow the color is cub who's with applicator looks like it's super quick and easy I already have mascara on your supplies and still wig I didn't have a lot of product in a little bit of product so you guys can kind of see how you can build it up so all you do is just blend it out guess what looks like this is what it looks like with more product and this is what it looks like with just a little bit I hope to get new colors of the soon and I would rate it a 10
