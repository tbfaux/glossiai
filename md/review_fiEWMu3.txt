lianarae reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: so this is the glossier priming moisturizer and I'm going to be using my primer mine comes out pretty liquidy as you can see I got all over my face it's super thin but it's really moisturizing and makeup sets really well on top of it and it provides a good amount of hydration and a nice go out there a lot of products that are like this but this is a good one
