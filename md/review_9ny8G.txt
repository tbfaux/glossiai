ontheglowNYC reviews The Full Glossier Brow by Glossier: hi guys I just got this brow duo in the mail from glossy a I already have a review with the boy brow but the brow flick just came out and this is my first time using it so, just looks like a little marker and it's got that Shaker in there so this is super delegate I really like it just to show you guys that's like with lot of pressure and if you do it's super late you could just get The faintest Strokes I feel like it really mimics my brow hairs and it's great because I'll have some little spots that need filling in so I think I definitely recommend this I really like it
