mollia716 reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: everyone I just got out of the shower and I thought I would take you through my night time routine so in the shower I actually use this mask of magnaminty from Lush and I just kind of used all over my face it's a courser like face scrub so I use it sparingly I don't use it like every time I wash my face maybe like once or twice a week sounds really nice but I didn't get like all of the dry patches off my face so I'm actually didn't go in with the color pads that was from super great recently and just kind of try and scrub like some of the skin off so this is what they look like they're very if a lot of texture and like little scrubbers kind of to use on your face it's very minty peppermint tea smelling which I like and they work really nicely I like him
