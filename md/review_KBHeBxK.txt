showyourglow reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: my third empty this month was the invisible children classic is an SPF 35 gel formula so this is for the person who hates sunscreen if you hate sunscreen whether it's because you don't like the send or if you have a darker complexion and you can't stand a white cast which obviously is super annoying and lucev in my opinion but I think that this is literally the best sunscreen for anyone who even slightly dislike something like you need this it is so good because it sinks into the skin and you can put it on top of your morning moisturizer so for my dry girls out there if you need a moisturizer underneath your sunscreen this will not pillow over your moisturizer or make any kind of weird situation under your makeup either is so good is gel it stinks and it's clear I wish I could show you but it's empty so I'm getting my hands on another one
