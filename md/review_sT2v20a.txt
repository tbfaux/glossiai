valchemic reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: hey guys this is my look for golf day I actually like it I've basically you know I'm wearing Charmed as well what's morgoth then white witches you know this is my favorite shows a child and I ended up re-watching it when I was older just understand what was actually going on and that was dope but anyways I didn't use highlighter because even though I thought about like vampire sparkling I checked her references and they don't Sparkle they're just very much and I could have tried and used like powder but I was like no it's going to get into that weird territory so I just intensified my brows and you sprout legs and glossy a I use some of this palette for the eyeshadow and added some cute flex and lipstick
