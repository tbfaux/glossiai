vegamfrancine reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: I've been really enjoying this glossier priming moisturizer which winter is really taking a toll on my skin so I haven't drank this morning and night and I really like it I like the thickness of the cream I like to send my skin is not very reactive so if you have sensitive skin then maybe I will try it out and see if I like it but I'm really enjoying it I think the packaging is gorgeous and I really like the brand and I love it
