thekristynedit reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so this is the glossy stretch concealer I have mine in the shade might I thought it was medium it's a little tiny pot with a whole bunch of product in it as you can see I have really used this concealer there's actually hair in it so the stretch concealer is extremely emollient but it is very easily blendable as you can see like look at how I like creamy and what it is is what it looks like when you first apply it oh my gosh got all over my nails but it's a really good concealer and it has really good coverage for like how glowy it is my one complaint is that even though you definitely need to set this concealer considered so wet it settled into these little lines I had no idea even had any my eyes I can kind of look crackly at the end of the day so I don't love it underneath the eyes but I do really like it all around my face
