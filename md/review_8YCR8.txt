glittercrocs reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: this is the glossy playing vinyl a clip I have it in the shade Pony here's a look of what the applicator is I'm you just pushed aside and then the product comes out one thing I do have a problem with is that it was sometimes just Creek in my bag by itself and you seem like product is coming out like I haven't clicked it but I really like the Shaded like the perfect formula for everyday it feels kind of like a gloss but it's not that glossy and it doesn't feel sticky at all so I'm going to go ahead and switch it on my arm I'm here is a Swatch of the formula I think it's a really pretty your lips but better shade and I really like using this for every day I would definitely recommend it if you want something that's lightweight on your lips but you want some color
