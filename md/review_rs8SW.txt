_emilymarie reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: so you guys probably know by now that I am a glassy-eyed girl through and through and of course I had to try their new play Line This is the glitter gel a and Bijou Bijou I added the lights you can see all the glitter it's super pretty it's a really fun like jelly texture I just like bounces back and it just like really pieces of glitter and it just stays on your LEDs for a super long time which is really nice I actually wore this for prom I'm a couple days ago and I got a lot of compliments and it was super easy to use and I didn't have to worry about like using glitter glue and loose glitter or anything like that so it was super easy to fly I love the packaging
