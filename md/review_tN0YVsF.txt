bound2glo reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so I've already reviewed Lashley but I really wanted to show you guys how I wear it everyday and it's really a part of my glow routine I have very long lashes and this is one of the only product that doesn't have that really weird transference on the bottom of my eyelids so I'm going to put it on and then show you the final look so I decided to actually put one eye on and show you how quick and easy it is I feel like you don't have to put a ton on to see the difference I really only use mascara on my top lid and I don't really like the bottom look I didn't curl so this is 100% just my natural eyelashes with the Lash like I did get a little bit on the top of my eyelids I'm going to clean that off and just talk about the final look how many times can I see if I don't look in the video let's count it literally looks like I'm wearing false eyelashes so that should be a big enough cosine that you need to buy this
