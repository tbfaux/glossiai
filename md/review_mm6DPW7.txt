lovelykishi reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello summer beginner at makeup and I didn't have any blush so I ordered glossier Cloud paint and I got into color Dawn and I actually really like this project and I think it's really easy to use since it's a liquid formula instead of a powder and I could just put the rain out on my cheeks is really picking the tip but like you can actually want it a lot to look at what can I get with Cher and I think this is great for beginners like me because it's like I'll paint you can just use your fingers as a great applicator
