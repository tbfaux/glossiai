slblandford reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys so today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier balm.com and I have it in the Rose shade I guess I really like it because it's very subtle sent but it's still really amazing so I like to just take a little bit like this and then spread it all over so I don't know how much you can tell but it has a very shimmery look to it when you put on which is amazing just for a lip balm because you can wear it out or you can just wear it for a nice little ChapStick and Spruce up your lips a little bit but overall the balm is very hydrating and I would definitely recommend it to anybody the little tube also goes a really long way so I would never worry about running out anytime soon
