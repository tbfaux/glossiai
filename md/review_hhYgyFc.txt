mikamishelle reviews Solution by Glossier: hi guys today I'm going to do a product review on the glossy a solution exfoliating skin perfector now this has 10% h a b h a m p h a and I also have a salicylic acid and it's a great friend acne treatment you use this after you cleanse you just grab a pot and paddle woe is me and you press it down on this and then you just clean your face with the Cotton Patch it does have a little bit of a tacky stickiness to it but it does strike down and just put your moisturizer on andI mean I give this product of four out of five I absolutely love it this is my second bottle now and I don't use this everyday but I do use it when I have stubborn acne or I need a little bit of exfoliating or brightening it this is a gentle exfoliating so if you want to use it three times a week that's perfect
