fourteencarrot reviews Futuredew by Glossier: hey guys coming at you at with the hot the hot scoop on glass see a future do it just want the sweet couple days ago I am loving this I'm going to demo it for you so I have nothing on my face right now I took all of my complexion off so I'm going to take one pump of the future do it's this amazing oil serum texture I was going to do half of my face so I applied it to this side of my face look at that gleam compared to this sideamazing but this is actually a skin care products with a blend of four oils so while it's giving you that highlight is actually moisturizing your skin I've been using this under my makeup every morning and all I need after is just some concealer cuz it is just reflecting the light reflecting the redness I love it
