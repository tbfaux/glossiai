lacyp reviews Generation G by Glossier: this is glossier Generation G and cake he was watching it on my skin it's supposed to be like a subtle Peach I went ahead and applied it on it definitely is a peach color I personally don't like the color on me and not really a peach person but the formula and the way of flies is the same as all the other ones obviously so do you like Peach lip colors I would definitely go for this cuz generation G is always and always
