ontheglowNYC reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys another pick up I got from glossy a was there lidstar this is a little bit of an Impulse buy but I never it's in the shade slip and its really pretty like baby Pink Panther sheet so you're just supposed to dab it on the lid and blend it out with your fingertips the packaging is super cute like test tube kind of thing and it has like this little doe foot applicator now we're going to go in and play this is like a super barely-there light wash of color so if that's what you're into I'd recommend getting it
