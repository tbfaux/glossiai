The Full Glossier Brow by Glossier: Start with clean brows—a fresh surface makes it easier to use Brow Flick. Holding the pen at a downwards angle, start where your brows are more sparse and etch lightly anywhere you’d like added dimension or definition. Leave to dry for 15 seconds or more. Brush up with Boy Brow to groom and hold.
