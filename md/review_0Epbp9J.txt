livnlifehbu reviews Glossier Phase 1 Set by Glossier: everyone's so I'm going to be showing you my philosophy set the first I'm going to use the Milky jelly cleanser so it is a white substance and basically I put this in the shower put on my face scrub it's really nice makes your face still really soft and I'm going to use the priming moisturizer I love this product so much it makes my face feels so so completely soft I honestly love this product I wouldn't pick anything else last but not least the lip balm so you basically don't want to use a lot it's kind of like Vaseline I hope you enjoyed all of them and I totally recommend and I hope you guys have an amazing day
