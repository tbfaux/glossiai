jules_r0se reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so this is the original this is the packaging it's like the same size as all the others it's super cute I really like it I used it before I go to bed and when I wake up because it just you know it doesn't really have any flavor but it's a really nice just kind of like hydration before I go to bed and when I wake up so that's what I really like to use that one for
