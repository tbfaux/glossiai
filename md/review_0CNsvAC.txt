yolk reviews Deodorant by Glossier: don't mind a swollen lip I actually have allergies right now but basically I haven't bought anything from glassy in a hot minute but when they dropped us and my favorite scent ever and it's not the use and it is the orange blossom Neroli I knew I had to get it has instructions on how to kind of put the product together because you saw you got one box for the case and then one box for the refill I just pop the refill on here, like twisted around a little bit and then I twisted the top to pop off the plastic part just so you know when you purchased the one that's $22 you get the case but if you just purchased the refill that's 18 you won't get the case but anyway the scent of this is pretty like muted and it's definitely like ski and a bit powdery it's not as like strong as like the body oil or the body lotion which is fine like it still smells pretty good for a deodorant
