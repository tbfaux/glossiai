virginiac reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so I'm going to be talking about glossier boy brow I'm just going to talk about it and then I'll show you what it looks like on my eyebrows so I decided that the first time I would try this I was going to clear just so that it wasn't like to pigmented and like look weird on my eyebrows because my eyebrows are kind of light but I really loved it like my eyebrows State like shaped and nice all day when I use this and it's really easy to use also the applicator just like that it's small it's really easy to use so I'm going to show you what it looks like when I use it so this is before and this is after so definitely after hearing like a lot of great reviews and trying at myself and loving it I think it's definitely worth the price because like I said it holds my eyebrows and shape all day and it looks really good and it's so easy to use that's pretty affordable so I really like it
