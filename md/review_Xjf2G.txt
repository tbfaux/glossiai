riyahtaylor reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: glossy play final a clip-in Pony this is supposed to be a high shine lacquer type lip product is supposed to be really cushiony buildable and not sticky easy click pen type of applicator my clip got messed up so I'm just going to reapply it for you guys here's the product what's really nicely on to the lips and I love that it has kind of a pointy aplicare that way it can kind of Chiclets as well with just that one coat you can tell that it gives a really good color payoff I feel like you could build us up but I'm really satisfied with the letter that I have on right now and how it looks it's not sticky at all really comfortable really picture that high shine lacquered look glossy look without any of like the gunk so I really like it
