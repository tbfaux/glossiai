emilydoes_makeup reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: if you follow me on Instagram you know that glossier stretch concealer is my absolute favorite concealer and wearing it now I honest-to-god wear it every single day around my nose or a mouth just to even out some of the discoloration adjust bike make myself look a little bit more live especially when you're wearing other makeup it's nice like spruce up your complexion a little bit but anyway I'm some people may say that this product is a little bit to do you can really see how reflective it is in this life but I think that is one of its greatest assets like it moves with your skin and adds a really nice amount of tautness and just like the perfect amount of coverage is full so I highly recommend this product so truly one of my absolute favorites in the old GE Range I was reading medium but now I'm shade G9 so if you are medium now you are G9 and they extended the shade range so I hope that more of you were able to try it because I really really really love this product
