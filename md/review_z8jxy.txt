lilyytay reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: I recently picked up glossier's milky oil as one of my super great rewards and I'm so happy that I did because it's such a great makeup remover I love that it's unscented and then it really helps to break down mascara and other eye makeup I do think it is a little bit pricey for the amount of product that you get but it's great to have four days when you I'm wearing more makeup like today just to help to get everything off I just watched a few glossy play products just to show you how it works and you only need a tiny amount and it gets everything off
