hannahroselund reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: I really do like the slip-on from Gauthier as a really good taste I'm not usually one for your sweet sense but this one is very good the packaging is really nice I love the sparkly thing at the top and yeah it's just a really good let them keep your lips hydrated for a long time I will say however that sometimes the mixture can separate until I kind of the oil but it's going to be easily fixed by just squeezing the two of you time
