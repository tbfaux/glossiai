julissaduenas reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: I totally forgot to talk hands-free but today I'm going to be talking about my newfound favorite Cloud paint from glossy day it comes in this cute little like Sleek packaging that you just like slide out and take it and it's really really really good it's a little tricky to like figure out at first but I'm wearing a little bit right now and it just really brings like a little flash of color to your face and I think it looks so natural and like it's just beautiful
