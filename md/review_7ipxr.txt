harmonym reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys it's Harmony and I'm back with another review for you guys same to me talk about the glossier balm.com now as you can see I have two of these I have one in Rose and a half one in birthday cake and I love these two deaths these are such an essential for any type of wipe their thick and I'm not greasy or oily so they don't leave your lips feeling gross and greasy or slippery that's one thing that I hate their effect they smell phenomenal and they do an amazing job moisturizing they're pretty big to have 2.5 fluid ounces the packaging is the cutest to die for and like I said they smell amazing to some Souls just like birthday cake and I love the smell of roses in this room smells just like roses you guys need to get your hands on these they are one of my life all time favorite lip balms and I think they're so cute and aesthetic and I love glassy-eyed and he's one of my favorite products so go get your hands on these if you're thinking about it do it is so worth it
