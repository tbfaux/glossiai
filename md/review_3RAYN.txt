getglossy reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to be talkin about glossy eyes lash slick so currently I only have mascara on this side looks like this I do not use this mascara with my lashes curled because I used to wear extensions and it kind of messed up my lashes regardless I think it looks like I have extensions when I wear this mascara I love it so much. Lee try it if you get a chance so I just went ahead and put mascara on my left eye is well the only drawback I can think of of this mascara would be that it doesn't hold a curl that well so that is something to consider but other than that I think it's absolutely greatI am idle my personal experience I don't have enough good things to say about it so
