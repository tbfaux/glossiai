theozhang reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: the glossier balm.com is probably the worst lip balm I've tried I know that some people really liked it but my skin hated it it broke out after I use it for about like 2 weeks to take non-stop using it and it irritated my skin so bad I had like so many pimples right here and is red and raised itchy and Flaky and is horrible this is $12 for basically what is a glorified tube of Vaseline I mean I know that some people like it but honestly it didn't add any moisture to my list and it's like Vaseline which means that if you don't have moisture already it won't add any this is probably one of the worst glossy products are tried so far however the glossy reps are really good or like the customer service is really really good so they returned my money on it but honestly I don't think it was worth it and I think you're better off trying something like Burt's Bees or just like Vaseline
