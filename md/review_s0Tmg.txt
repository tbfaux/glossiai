fourteencarrot reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: let's review the glass A play vanilla lip and Tony tip and then you have to click the end to release the product into the sponge I haven't had any issues with this I think it actually really fits with that texture of the product but I did notice in my purse last night it did get clipped a couple times unintentionally overall I love the formula it's super soft and pillowy it doesn't feel sticky at all and it is shiny but I love is sweeping it on as a bomb like that stop it
