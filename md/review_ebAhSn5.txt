zameena reviews Skywash by Glossier: this is the glossy a sky wash eyeshadow in the shade lawn it is a liquid to powder e eyeshadow it has best applicator a karthus since it came out basically this is how it applies and then you just type it out so a lot of people didn't love this product when it came out but it is really grown on me I think the issue might have been that at the point that this came out people were super experimental with their eye looks or at least not the glossy a crowd but now we're all about a pop of color and I love this is such a beautiful color it doesn't wear super long but I like how natural looks
