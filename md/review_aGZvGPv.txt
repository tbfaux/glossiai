beautybymonamarie reviews Generation G by Glossier: this is the glossier generation G lipstick in the shade zip this lipstick is very sheer but you could build up the coverage with layers the formula is unique it's not very creamy but it's more of a waxy balmy texture it has a matte finish I really really like it it retails for $18 on the glossy a website this is the perfect product to achieve that blotted lip effects it doesn't give a lot of definition to the outline of the lips more of like a casual lived-in look
