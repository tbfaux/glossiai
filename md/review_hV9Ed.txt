jules_r0se reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so this one is the Rose lyrics long as you can tell if this one's the one I've had the longest little more beat up but I I mean I really love this one a I love the packaging I really like the Deep green with the pink obviously it's like reminiscent of a rose which is really cute this one has a light pink tint I never personally really notice it on my lips but I think it's like as just that little cuteness factor and the flavor is just like awesome I love Rose flavored things and this one is just absolutely perfect
