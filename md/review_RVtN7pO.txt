Lia_reviews reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: hey guys in this video I'm going to be reviewing the glassy Road tip eyeliner so I got to district for Christmas and I hadn't tried it out yet so I thought I'd try it tonight so at this is what it looks like it's the prettiest classic tank with plastic on it so I'm going to do the island and I'll come back okay so I did it and this is before I use Liquid liner Barraza. It's really nice it's really easy to remove and clean up as well I like how it's also pretty dark for just like headliner the tip is super thin and so it's really easy to get a ring shapeit's also surprisingly really sturdy so it was kind of hard but it does it does have soda move around at the end so I'm going to put her on and then I'll come back for the final like review this with liquid liner I really like it I definitely recommend it
