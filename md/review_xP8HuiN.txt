melodiepinkchampagne reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hi super great today I'm going to review the glossier Lash slick mascara one of my friends gave it to me recently and I've been using it every day and I just love it if it looks very natural and it's super easy to apply and it also doesn't Farm any plums on your lashes I'll try to show you by getting closer as you can see it looks very natural is very subtle and that's exactly what I'm looking for in a mascara and it also makes your eyelashes look longer but it's not too much which is why I really love it I would definitely give it five stars out of five and I would really love to try some more of glossier
