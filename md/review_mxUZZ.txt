nicoleviccica reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so this is hands-down my favorite blush of all time I just heard using it this summer and I'm obsessed with glasses Cloud paint so I just apply it with my hand or finger and I just rub it in and I find it just gives me like the nicest natural blush 6 like cute I love it very sheer but it's super glowy
