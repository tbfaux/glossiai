nevibaby reviews Futuredew by Glossier: what to do with little unboxing stay my glasses I ordered came in super excited this is the future do I have only tried the sample so this is technically a first impression full-size but not a first impression of the product I have tried it for and I liked it that's why I bought it again actually got it in a set with the milk jelly cleanser and save think it was like $15 or something like that but it's stunning is absolutely beautiful with everything you want in a really pretty package I'm pretty sure it is glass and I'm really excited to use it it's a pretty pink pop I love it I'm going to use this tomorrow I don't like using it in my night routine cuz I already did kind of the oily face products I don't need anymore but I'm really excited to have this and so I thought I'd just stop by here and show you all what else like that
