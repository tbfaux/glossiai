harmonym reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: the next step is one of my dupes for the jelly cleanser and this is Instead The Milky jelly cleanser in this is by glossy eye this is the small version of what I have two of these small versions and as you can see I don't know I've made a fair dent on this I really enjoy this as a very basic cleanser um it's not going to strip your skin it's not going to ever dry your skin it's not going to get off all of your makeup and that's why I definitely recommend for anybody that wears makeup to do a double cleanse but I think this is awesome if you have sensitive skin you do have to be careful there is a slight sin chew at 4 because it's just very gentle and it has a very nice milky consistency that I think works well for most every skin type but it's going to be best for people with sensitive skin or more on the dry side of skin and it just works well it's a basic cleanser it smells good it works really nicely and it doesn't my skin feeling very dry or stripped
