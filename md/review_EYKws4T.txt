gabreviews reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: Hi Sam I'm doing a review on the glossy a birthday balm.com and I said this is my last review which was for the mango one that I just got these in the mail a few days ago so I'm still trying them out but for First Impressions this one smells like really really good like this is probably my favorite one and it smells just like birthday cake exactly how they say and this has a nice glittery shine in it which I really like because it's like nice and glossy but it also has those little specks of glitter. The light bounce off of which is really pretty for a nice glowing simple makeup look or you don't want to really wear a Fancy lip and the tube is really pretty on this one so I think I would recommend this one over the mango one because it has a really nice tube and it smells amazing and it comes as advertised with the glitter
