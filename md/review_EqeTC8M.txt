pergoddess reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: now that color made me want to wear some blush and I'm going to use the glossier cloud paint in the color dusk in this Super Bowl to this one looks like this so this is been a tried-and-true at absolutely positively love this blush and I don't even like blush like that but this is how much I put and I put it between these two fingers doing the room I'm sorry it took the apples up my cheek it gives it a nice flush look at my opinion not too too blushy if you are afraid of blushed like myself but I absolutely positively love this I think is great with an or without makeup and it's brown girl friendly which is what prompted me to buy it in the first place and it was the color of them dancing queen that just made me feel like I needed to use this oh yeah
