Gabriella reviews Solution by Glossier: hi guys I'm going to be talking about the glossy a solution so this is a product that I purchased before in the past and I really did love it the first time I tried it and I just totally forgot about it never repurchased it but I did rebuy it I put it on last night before I went to bed and my skin care on top of it I noticed that I was starting to break out a little bit when I woke up I had no breakouts they were completely flat and my skin was so much brighter so I do really love this product I also like the applicator so you just basically put a cotton pad on and dispense by pushing with the top down so you don't waste any product that way and it's really not that expensive either it's about 30 bucks so if you're looking for an exfoliant at night definitely buy this one
