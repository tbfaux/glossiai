kaylaegbers reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to be reviewing this classy a milk jelly cleanser and I've actually had this for a while now you can tell I don't really use it that often because it's not my favorite product but here's why so the main reason I don't like this product is because of the texture and I get it does say jelly cleanser on it but I just don't like the feeling of it I just feel like it doesn't really stick to my skin or even cleans it doesn't feel as if I just spent time washing my face
