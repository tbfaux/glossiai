riyahtaylor reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: glossy mango bomb.com play lie I've used it already and it is so good it really does have like a fresh juicy and mango flavor sorry I'm literally at the farmers market but it has like a tiny peachy pink tint and Des Lux smells amazing you know the usual bomb.com it comes with this really cute fruit sticker sheet obsessed definitely a must for the spring and summer
