kendrae reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hi everyone so I'm going to talk about this with my little makeup look I have one I have the Lash slick on my eyes the Halo scope and a little bit of Fenty on my cheek and this the glossy lip gloss on my lips this is the holographic one I love glossy things I love looking do we almost sell this is one of my favorite things but I also like the sparkle so of course I got it in the holographic I probably will end up buying the clear one but I have to work more than do that so I'll of the applicator of this one like that is clear I think it's very sleek and I just love how it bends and you put it on your lips it's not sticky and I feel like it last really long time so this is one of my go-to so
