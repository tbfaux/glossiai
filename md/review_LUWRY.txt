alexissaidso reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: all right of course I'm going to throw in a glassy eye product who hasn't review to Gauthier product but a lot of the things I wouldn't give a 10 out of 10 but I would give the marketing a 10 out of 10 and there are a few products that I do swear by from them one of them is bomb.com for sure about. Com just makes my lips feel really really good so this is the consistency of it you can tell that it's very thick I'm like a bomb really should be and then I put it on with my finger I'm assuming that's what most people dobut I like this one has a red tint to it what are they so good it's not my number one bomb in America but it is the number one glossy eye product I would say
