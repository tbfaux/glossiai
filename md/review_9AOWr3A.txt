audry reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: all right though for my blush I like to use the famous classic Cloud paint I like using more orange shade on my skin tone I just feel like it suits me better and less vibrant this is literally the most pigmented plush I've ever used you do not need more than this I'm going to go over it with acetone or which I know was a little odd but that's what I was doing it always like that outlet back on the music of beauty blender I want to actually put on the response that surprising I like that always helps me if I smile while I do it make them look more natural and less droopy sometimes I blend it on my eyes as well and then if I have time I just like to take a little bit to skintint put it on over and make it more natural and then you spend it out
