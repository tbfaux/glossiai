alysonrose reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I had a sample size of the mint balm.com from glossy a I heard a lot of people really really really love this is a good lip balm don't get me wrong but it kind of to me was underwhelming and not something I would want to pay that much for a pretty dry lips in the winter is most people do and it's just like is like a regular lip balm to me you have to reapply every couple of hours it's not really that spectacular so not bad but I wouldn't spend the money on it to get the full size
