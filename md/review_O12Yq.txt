nicolebiscardi reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey super grade I wanted to talk about the class A boy brow I've been using it pretty consistently lately I really like it cuz it I use the clear one and it kind of just hold her brows in place but I really like it cuz I don't do a whole much to my eyebrows I don't really feel them in so I get them threaded every month and a half so it kind of just keeps them looking like they're nice and clean even if they are in and then you can just plug around the areas that are followingpower definitely right this time after 10 if you want to try the brown or the blonds depending on your hair color I would recommend that as well but I don't really think it's needed unless you really have some you no open spots to Helen but I love the clear one that works for me
