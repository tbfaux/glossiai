ontheglowNYC reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: hey guys so I basically did a first impression for on the glossier's Datsik now this is my second impression I guess after actually using it while the packaging is nice and all I find out this product really isn't effective at the time of using it I kind of had a blemish on my chin and I felt that it prolong the life of my pimple and usually they just like go away overnight for me and it made my skin super dry there it also kind of left like a hyper pigmented red mark on my skin I have a small blemish here and I'm definitely not even going to use it on my skin I have likeoily kind of skin and I guess if yours is sort of like mine I really don't recommend this product
