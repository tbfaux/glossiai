lilyytay reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: my skin has been breaking out like crazy lately not sure why probably because of hormones and being stuck inside all the time but I thought I would share some products that have been helping my skin a lot starting with the glossier mega greens Galaxy Pack this is my favorite face mask of all time I think it really helps to detoxify it without drying your face out at all the stuff really helps to calm down any irritation or blemishes you might be having and it's a clay mask but it doesn't leave your skin dried or stripped out at all which is what I love the most about this Ivory purchase this many times and I will continue to do that in the future cuz I can't not have this in my collection
