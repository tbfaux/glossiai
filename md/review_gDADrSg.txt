thechicmachine reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys so I just finished my PGE girl look and I'm going through some of the main products that I used I've also already talked about the colour-pop sweet talk palette so definitely check that one out if you are interested in how I did the I look now for any girl like you have to have like a lot of blushed and I've done a girl looks before and I've seen it with like the purples in the pink but this time I want to do a peachy one and I was like okay where am I going to get a peachy like blush color cuz it's really hard to find for dark skin and incomes glossy a cloud paints I mix the shades Dawn and storm to get the ultimate peach color actually shows up on my skin and then I just put it on like crazy and I actually to dab some off with a beauty blender because I had too much which you think you can't have too much any girl look but you definitely can it looks phenomenal It Blend fantastically and I love that I can create my own colors
