pressedflowersss reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys so I don't know if anyone mention but gloss a release date Brown shade of their last like I actually ironically never tried the black one but this is the brown and it gives a nice natural fluff kind of lash when you curl it and I really like it if it was really good and lengthening and separating and hold it and doesn't give too much drama that opens up the eyes and I just really like how it looks on the face and I think with this I'm just going to pair a little bit of my blush oil on my cheeks today so let's do a tiny little bit and this is buy used for you just two little B right there just type it into place just give me a nice little glow for the day have a nice day guys hope you like the review
