devinkielle reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: so I'll be honest I really have a love-hate relationship with the glasses that stick when it first came out I do not think like the directions were a hundred percent clear Maybe not today or actions but like the warnings so like every time I've ever used it stick and just applying it it always look left of burn like a burn mark kind of like that like that was like around this body breakout bump I've had for a while but it was like a dark dry patch and obviously like when you're rubbing something with like a roller ball on your face like it's not a hundred percent just going to stay on the spot that needs to be treated it was around it and it would be literally like dark circles on my face but with this breakout being a little bit more stubborn I thought that was at 6 would work really well and it has helps with drying out some of the ones I've been having trouble with
