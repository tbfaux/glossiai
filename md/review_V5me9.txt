mikayla_rose_lynn reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hello everyone so today I wanted to do a first impressions of glossier lash slick so I would never try glossy mascara before I've loved every single other product that I've tried by and I saw a girl Tour review on the Lash slick on YouTube and her eyelashes ended up going all the way to her eyebrows so I'm like yes I will definitely try that and I've also been loving where I just do my top lashes with mascara I just love how this is separating my eyelashes and lengthening them it's not clumping at all it's really beautiful I have super short lashes so this is awesome guy
