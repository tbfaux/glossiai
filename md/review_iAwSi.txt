Schirb reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: another gossier must have the cloud paint in Puff I've been using the Nars powder blush for the past like 7 years so I was looking for something a little bit different to mix into my routine it's got a really nice subtle pink tint to it you can't really see it here as much in this lighting but that's okay it's it's a little bit more like a flush look I made them so they can put in a little bit too much on on this hand and that's okay if it does fade throughout the day it's always to your preference of how much or how little you want to put on your cheeks I probably use the cloud pain every other day on my cheeks I still use my power brush is cuz I like to give myself live in a variety of my makeup routine but I love this product and I think it's definitely a must-have
