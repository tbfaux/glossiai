alexajustine reviews Generation G by Glossier: so I just got home from work and I saw that my package from super great arrived which absolutely made my day so with some of my coins I decide to get the glossy a generation G lipstick in the shade cake and of course glossy a does an amazing job with their packaging can never have enough of these pink cases and Elsa came with this sample of their concerts I'm super excited about so the shade looks gorgeous packaging is always on point with glossy and I love a good nude color so it can't wait to try this outalready so I have it on now absolutely love the shade you can't ever have enough Lee nude lipstick it feels super nice on the lips and it doesn't matter lipstick however it does not feel drying whatsoever and I love how it has this almost blotted out luck I feel like it could be buildable though if I want around a few more times overall I'm really happy with this
