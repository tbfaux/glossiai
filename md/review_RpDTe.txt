tru_beauty reviews Solution by Glossier: hi guys this is a follow-up I guess part 2 review of the glossy a solution last review I made it was kind of when I first got it and was only using it for about a week so I hadn't really seen results yet so this is just to show you the results is my face without any makeup no concealer no color corrector or Foundation or anyting the results of using this every night for 4 weeks and you haven't you do have to use this consistently to get results this isn't like a spot treatment or anyting salicylic acid is not meant to be a spot treatment it's supposed to be consistently applied everyday and I had really bad pimple scars on the corner of my mouth and really bad redness from breakouts I've had in my T-Zone last time I made this review and now the redness is definitely lessened and these pimple scars are like all gone like I never had anything over here so this is actually pretty good I guess life is real
