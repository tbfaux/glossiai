nataliexo8 reviews Generation G by Glossier: hi guys I'm going to be reviewing glossier's generation G staying I guess this is what it looks like in the bottle but on my lips it doesn't really it's kind of a Shear consistency so it doesn't really show up as much it kind of just shows on my natural lip color so you have to build it up a lot it feels like a crayons and kind of drying I don't really like the texture I like a lot of moisture and I don't think it's as pigmented as I would like it to be but it's decent for everyday wear I probably wouldn't buy it at its full price I got it as a deal with other glossier's stuff but I probably wouldn't recommend
