elizabethhhloves reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so this is the glossier stretch concealer in the shade G9 which is I think the original medium shade they came out with and then they I think I deduct a bunch of other shade which is amazing but I still think that it could be extended a little bit more just cuz I feel like there's only like 10 Shades or something but I love this concealer so much I'm actually currently using this to sort of act as a tinted moisturizing and bass for my skin so I'm not putting on any since moisturizer todaysorry that's my dawg I like to use this as sort of a super light coverage complexion products because it looks so much like skin I could just gives your skin a beautiful glow while adding a little bit of coverage super creamy is pigmented and it just yet it's beautiful on the skin I would send it with powder
