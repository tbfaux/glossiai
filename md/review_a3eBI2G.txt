katieee reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys so I made a review just a little bit ago on the vitalist healthy glow Illuminator by Covergirl and I thought it looked so much like the glossy and let's start in the shade Cub so I actually free in the vital us and then I can have a cup and glass case I was watching for you and show you guys how similar they look all right so the one on the right is the vilest one and then on the left is glossier's so at these are such pretty products and I mean both of them are amazing so like and if you want to save a few extra bucks like definitely try it so I'm going to put on my eyes so we can compare all right so this is a glossy a side and this is the viola side lost he was definitely a little bit easier to put on it's more creamy and it's easier to build up but honestly like public really good so yeah
