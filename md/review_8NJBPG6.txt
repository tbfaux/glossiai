zenyoubih reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so eyebrows are done not going to put on Foundation or concealer or anything like that because I'm really focusing on my skin during the quarantine instead of putting on makeup even for like a second because I break out so easily so I've just been really kind of focus on that lately but if you want to go the extra mile I usually use my vertly lip butter which I've been loving but if not and you can use a lip gloss like lost yeah it's pretty expensive for a lip gloss in like this is a really small size but I've had this for so long so I definitely lost but this is a shine on it this is like the final look I suppose so thanks for watching and yeah
