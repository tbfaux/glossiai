aurorabeauty reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: this is Lagasse a statistic twist the bottom for the product mindless rollerball and then you can just rub it wherever you have cysts I would definitely does work well but it definitely burns my skin a little bit so I don't know how to feel about that I don't think I will be repurchasing this since it is a little too hard for me but maybe this works for someone else whose skin isn't as sensitive as mine
