lilyytay reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: this is the vanilla clip from glossy play in the shade blow-up I've done a review on the shade Pony before but I've been wearing this one so much lately so I thought I would talk about it if you're someone who likes a glossy lip this will definitely be right up your alley I'm so happy I pick these up because the formula is super comfortable and I like that you can build them up for a full intensity look or wear them with just one or two layers for a more sheer look it comes with a click style applicator and a fuzzy tip and this is what the car looks like this is about three different layers and it's pretty pigmented as you can see
