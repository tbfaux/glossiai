dryskinreviews reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey it's now I'm going to go in with my fingers again with this stretch concealer from glossy I think we would get the comparison between my eyes I think it actually has pretty good coverage for being a glossy a product like that visibly brighten I think that it's best for under eyes rather than acne-like I'll show you what it looks like on my chin dimples in a second minimizes them but if you're looking for a full coverage products I wouldn't use this but I still really I think that it's if you lose again like very late on the skin it doesn't claim to dry patches it doesn't emphasize fine lines and I could see like if this is the way that she is at this isn't an option for me but using this as a like a highlight when your contouring so alright auction The Next Step
