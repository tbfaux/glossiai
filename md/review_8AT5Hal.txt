pergoddess reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I'm sure I mentioned this before I don't know if this is but not supposed to do this but I had to come back this is fairly empty and once again closer has outdone themselves I live for this lip balm and when they say Universal skin Salve they absolutely mean it is great for the cuticles elbows physically anyway you can potentially need some kind of moisturizer. Moisturizer this is just like the perfect super small convenient to keep in your bag I wouldn't recommend the meant for like your elbows and things like that but if you had nothing else this will definitely serve the purpose super moisturizing and it definitely last really long I love this before bed for my skin care regimen during work hours just anytime this is a true Gem and I need to re-up as soon as possible
