mollia716 reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: I'll be reviewing the body here on the ocean so I suggest I like to use this after I shower and I usually use it on my legs and my arms I usually use about this much on my legs and it smells really good kind of like a cherry laurel small-time expense I've had this August play it's not half of it I would recommend it if you'd like if it specially if you'd like the spend and then if you were looking for something to use after the shower to moisturize all over your body however it is kind of expensive for what it is and I'm not totally sure if I would buy it again but I was saying I'm in the middle on this one
