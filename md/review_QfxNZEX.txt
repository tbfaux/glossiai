zenyoubih reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay so these are the lashes look he can clearly see the corners like popping up so I'm going to be quick about this because who knows how long this is going to last if I blink too damn much so I'm going to take glossier Cloud paint in the color storm I already put too much on my finger I already know that this always happens I'm just going to tap it once and then toy and then I'm going to type it out with my other finger only balls of my cheeks very very pretty color I like kind of go back to the Salat but if I'm not using this one that I'm most definitely using the small pallets from undone Beauty because they are just as good I'm going to tell them your time just to get the color back there a little bit more poop and then top it out very nice and natural yeah
