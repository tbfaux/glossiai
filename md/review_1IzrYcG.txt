Ciara_hendricks2 reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: everyone today we're doing a product review on the glossy priming moisturizer compared to the other class A priming moisturizer so when you use the this priming moisturizer this one is a lot more liquidy and drips a little bit more but I like it because it is really priming and compared to this one it's a really thick priming moisturizer if you could see more thick compared to the two as you can see drippy a little bit but they're both really good products but I don't know which one I like better actually this one is more priming and this one's more moisturizing but whatever you guys like it's up to you both of these are really good products and I definitely suggest both of these
