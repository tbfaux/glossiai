vbellorin10 reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to be reviewing it does glossier cloud paint in the colored Dawn I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure that this product is $18 and I got it online I really recommend this product because a little bit goes a long way so you only have to use a little thought when you're going to use it and I currently have it on and for this color I really like the orange e-book that it gives me a kind of business sunburned look which I really like since it is a liquid you can really build it pop but if you do use too much it does soak into your skin because it is liquid and it gives you a natural look which I really like overall I really recommend this blush
