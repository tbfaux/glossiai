jessie_rodriguez reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: this cleanser by far is one of my most favorite ones this is the second concert that I use in my skincare routine and it just is like juice helps my face just glow and help to just become so radiant and it's just so cute I got this as a birthday gift from one of my very best friends her name is skincare honey she's on the sap so check her out but so I never really was into glossier until she gave us to me and the milk jelly cleanser I only used two pumpsand it's watching me since June so I think everyone should try this out as their first product from glossier so yeah
