Smash13 reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys so as I said I'm a luxury few I'm about to go run some errands so and I do like to put on a little bit of makeup before I go and do that so I put on my foundation and some lip gloss and it's going to go in with a little bit of this glossier lidstar in the shade Moon so I do like to just Pat some on with the applicator just a little bit I'm really slowly but surely like really starting to like this product and that I just Pat in with my finger this is very very lightly just a blend and the product I'm loving it already I'm all right and I did just put on this with eyes and I think I'm ready to go run my errands and maybe meet up some people for lunch who knows
