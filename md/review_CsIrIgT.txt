glossiergirlll7 reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so this is that glass see a cloud paint in the shade. Where it's very pretty I think it looks really natural color almost looks like how I do it looks burnt in I know I like sunburn you look cute but I really like this and I would recommend it it's very pigmented as well so you can only use a little bit on your finger and it will last you with such a long time
