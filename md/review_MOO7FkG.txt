mollia716 reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: okay so this is the glitter jelly from glossy a and glass Bonsai took a really pretty gold multi color product that came with this little silicone brush to help put it on your eyelids so I'm going to dab a little is very pigmented I'm going to put this on my eyelid a little bit so I want to have kind of that like Sleek back look with my hair and I'm going to use the glitter jelly like on my part I hope this is not too hard to get out of my hair I don't know if you can quite see the Shimmer but this is kind of the best stuff to use in your hair if you want to have it glittery I was at a party at one point a pool party like last year and I use for my hair and it turned out amazing
