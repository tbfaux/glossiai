nataliexo8 reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hi everyone I'm going to be reviewing glossier boy brow in brown I haven't applied on this eyebrow but not this eyebrows oh no it's a difference I have my eyebrows filled in with Bobbi Brown eyeshadow I usually pair the two I usually don't use this alone because it doesn't really like take care of like the sparse patches but it does definitely give you more of an intense look see it has a little kind of spoolie applicator and you just let you know us a huge difference when he pulled in but sometimes there's like kind of chunky there's kind of INXS on the brush so you have to be careful kind of wipe it off before you apply it I do notice it coats the hair evenly which is really nice I would definitely buy again specially for anyone who has their eyebrows it's really helpful
