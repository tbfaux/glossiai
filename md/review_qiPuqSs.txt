gabil reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: this is glossier boy brow in Brown this is my favorite brow Pomade and is a hero product of mine it keeps my eyebrows in place all day and feels in a spot where I don't have that many hairs small applicator last me cover my eyebrows evenly I definitely recommend this product to everyone as I've never seen a better brow Pomade gel or anything of the sort I really like the packaging as it is very sleek and clean and although it's a very tiny it last long time it is reasonably priced and I think my favorite product from LA CA
