aperpich reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys okay so say I'm going to be reviewing this milk jelly cleanser by glossy a this is a super excited as it's a conditioning face wash and it really is like it's so good for dry skin really has like it's like sick and you can feel that it's hydrating when you're putting it on so I love it so far I've been using it for the past like 3 weeks I think and it just made my skin like so soft and during the winter that's like so nice cuz I really dry skin so yeah I've just been loving it so it says that you can use it on dry or damp skin but I like to just let my skin a little bit and then I use about this much just one pump it's more than enough for your whole face one thing I will say about this is like it's not a very like deep cleansing product so if you really like a good cleanser this probably isn't before you just makes your skin super-soft and refreshed like after a long day or it for bed
