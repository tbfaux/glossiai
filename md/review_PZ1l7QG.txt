allison_perez reviews Skywash by Glossier: so make sure you guys what I've been loving so I actually haven't on this I hear it's really subtle but that's something that I want I do have pretty dark Lids however this kind of brings a nice even base and I'm going to show you the finished product after I'm done with all my makeup to and this is the finished look I really like these eyeshadows I used Bali and Tara and it just give me a really nice natural Shadow on my lip and something simple super easy you don't easy to put on it's just really great I really do really like these and I'm getting more color soon
