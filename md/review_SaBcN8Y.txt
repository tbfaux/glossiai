RelatableRach reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: I was going to do super glow first but then I couldn't get super great to register on this year I'm so fine we'll do a Super bounce it's okay I adore Garcia because of the packaging and I will actually apply while we talk about this hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 serum I do like the bounce a little bit more than the glow so I guess with that being said just take two drops and I apply on the high points of my face this is perfect to pair with the super glow by glossy and I use them together mostly for summer so I'm moving out of the skin care routine I can tell that my Skin's not benefiting as much of course I still continue to use things to benefit on circulation but yeah
