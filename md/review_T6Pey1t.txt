legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: Chris Chris was still talking about this Cloud paint from glossy and the shade Dawn so like I said I would really like if they could just change this container as far as I know they've kept it the same since it's been released like 5 years ago and I think I seen this complaint quite a few times on the internet so it seems like I'm not the only one who constantly feels like I'm wasting so maybe I could just make the noise of a little bit smaller solem8 it's not that big to begin with but right now like when I squeeze it just so much comes out of it I don't know if there's another way to make it like easier to control but yeah like it's just right now it just way too much of it comes out maybe changing to a do fat applicator might be better if you like that lets you control things better like I know that might have issues with contamination but this is only 12 months anyways so I don't think like it's long-lasting to begin with
