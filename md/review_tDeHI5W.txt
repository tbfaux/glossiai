kendrae reviews Colorslide by Glossier: everyone so this is the glossy a play color slide in the color stable relationship I did too reviews of these are the review on two of these a little bit ago I have the blue one the light blue one and pretty penny I think and I've been wearing those a lot to pretty penny and this one I think we're going to go really good for Christmas colors this is It's watched It's just super seamless velvety like I loved you so much it's so easy to put on I am not going to put makeup on right now but yes I am not a big fan of make-up I'm not very good at it but I have had very good success with these and I love topping it with the fluid-like party glitter eyeliners and I think this one will go really good with the green one in the blue one so yeah it's just a hand in hand thing and it's just a way
