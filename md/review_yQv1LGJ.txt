ingjo reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys this is a glossier cherry balm.com okay I know it's very overpriced scented and since has Vaseline in tube form but there's something about this product that just makes it so worth the $12 that it cost I think it's partially because it reminds me of a cherry Icee and I know it's a bit more controversial but I personally I think it's like you love it or hate it and I personally absolutely love it and another thing about it is the formula I find a really moisturizing despite it being petroleum jelly face and there's something it just feels it's like stays on your lips healing nicely in Statesville all day so yeah I highly recommend it I think it's worth $12 despite it being basis expensive gasoline
