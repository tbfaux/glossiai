getglossy reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys today I'm talking about mango bomb.com so as soon as glossy announces product I basically bought it right away I saw the packaging and with the start of spring I'm just in such a summary mode so it's like I need this the product itself is pink and it's so cute I think this really looks and feels like the other bomb.com smells amazing just like mangoes and you guys should definitely definitely definitely check it out to get in the summer mood
