sincerelyshreya reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: all right so I have just applied glossier's Cloud paint and does he don't get that much it looks like you don't get a lot of products but it's actually a lots a little goes a long way so I just asked you a little bit on to the back of my hand use a brush in the busted in my skin so it looks like this close-up actually on my mascara so ignore that glossy is not a company that is really for a full face makeup looks on if they really promote makeup looking as Skin So gloss he has a company their products are more for a natural dewy look and that's why I like it for every day look so it looks like it was going to get a lot of product to end of that little too but you do and if you want 10% off I have a discount code that you can use so comment down below if you want to use that buy doesn't recommend it should be good for all skin types and safe to use on sensitive skin Clips what I have as well sensitive combination skin so I highly recommend this
