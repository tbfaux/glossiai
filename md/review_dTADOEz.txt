kaiviolet reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey buddy you know I love my mom. Calms and I just bought three more so I'm going to try them out in the video for you and it's so pretty I love the color and it's kind of like a cherry popsicle it's the Cherry Bomb.com I love it. I really like the color thing with this one it's very like peachy I put it on my finger and it's like clear this is the foam on it doesn't have any color and it just makes me look. Look very pretty but it has an okay sent so I'll give it that but do you have any color but I loved his lip balm start the best LeBron's ever I wear them all the time and they're really moisturizing so I'll get this about a 6 out of 10 I'll do the birthday cake one in the next video by 8:10 for the cherry and six out of ten for the coconut
