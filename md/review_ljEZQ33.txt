danya_ reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hi guys so of course I own the glossier clear lip gloss this was the original before they came out with any of them so what I really like about this lip gloss is not only the applicator like the elf one but the fact that it's super thick and super glossy and so as you can see it just one swipe my lips Super Chinese I love that is thick it's not too sticky which is really nice it smells absolutely fabulous you may consider to be super small but it does last a really long time and so does the application silver all you really do recommended lip gloss I absolutely love it it's really one of my favorites
