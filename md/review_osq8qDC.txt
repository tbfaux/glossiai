andreamilat reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys today I'm reviewing the glossier balm.com I'm reviewing mango and coconut so we're going to start off with coconut this is what the packaging looks like when you squeeze it out it comes out in this very thin texture it's not too thin or it's a gloss but it's not too thick where it's a full cream it applies very smoothly and it smells like sugar the mango one is this what it's look like when you squeeze out it has a light pink Coral tint like that the tint doesn't stay when you rub it in but it's very pretty for looks if you have the chance I do suggest getting these products because they're really good
