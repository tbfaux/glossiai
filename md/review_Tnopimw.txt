priscilla reviews Futuredew by Glossier: so this is glossier's future do this is a oil serum hybrid the directions say to apply to bumps all over your face I do not do that I find it that's too heavy and greasy for me so I just use literally a half a pump and I just kind of a rub it on the tips of my kind of fingers and I only put it on like the high points of my face so like where I would like apply highlighter kind of right here sometimes I do my forehead just because that's usually where I put in a dress like a nice healthy glow to my skin I really like how it even if I don't wear makeup this is like my last at cuz it kind of looks like I put highlighter on and if I am wearing highlighter I feel like it's just like a huge boost and it just makes me look so healthy and I love that
