ninacampbell reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: also going to review one of the products I bought from glossy play it is the vanilla clip and I got it in the color blow up which is a candy Pink Just Like kind of quick it up I think those colors just so so so so so pretty super moisturizing super flattering feels so nice on the lips doesn't have a time of staying power but that's okay to be functions like a lip gloss and I love it I a hundred percent recommend I mean
