devinkielle reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: I feel like it's kind of hard to see but on the inner corner I put the glossy Play Glitter to lay in the shade firewalk I never knew the names of anything but in the shade firewalk it's like gorgeous rose gold glitter and I'll show you a close so it's the tiniest little smudge but like right above the marooned nudestix is the glitter gel and fire walk and this is what it looks like in a jar super pretty Just a Touch
