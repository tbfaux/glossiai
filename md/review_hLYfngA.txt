Parris_noextra reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so I finally got this lip gloss I usually don't wear clear lip gloss but I figured hey there so much hype around it was the worst could happen it doesn't have any lip Plumping capabilities which is awesome cuz some people are just big enough some honest review is a place is amazing it goes on really smooth in the end it's very I don't know if it is moisturizing of his heels moisturizing it feels like my lips are coated but not sticky and healthy to go really well on top of semi lip stains and longwear lip colors
