gracehkang reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so I recently just purchased the glossier Lash slick I've never used any glossier products before but I heard that they were affordable and the everyone loves so far everyone who I talk to you love is it I got it actually in the set with the line the pro tip liner the slick and then makeup remover I would just $32 not that bad for all three but definitely I love this mascara it definitely separates all my eyelashes because I do have smallereyelashes if you can't tell but definitely definitely will purchase again
