Naomishorti reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: glossier moisturizing Moon mask and I've only used it once but the one time I did use it was great it cost about $22 which I don't think is that bad because one is really big and it's filled a lot and it's going to last a long time for me because I don't use this kind of stuff all that often but yeah it's great and it made my skin so soft and moist risible moisturized yeah
