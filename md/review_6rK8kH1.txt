sammybeth2000 reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: hi I think that this product actually is very grateful for your skin if you're looking to put it on before makeup now I usually do it before I put on my Foundation because it helps glide on smoother and then instead of using a beauty blender I usually use a brush and glide on your makeup smooth but not only that helps get rid of pimples it usually takes a couple days for it to go away but my skin as you can tell I've been using it every single day and it's much better than what it used to be
