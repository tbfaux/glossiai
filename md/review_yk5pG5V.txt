zoeowens reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys so I picked up the glossier balm.com trios and the flavors Rose mango and birthday cake and these are some of my favorite lip balms that I have I don't know a lot of people so it's they're so cute they're super affordable and I'll show you how to do it so it's real simple you take it you open it there's a little shimmers in yet but there's little shimmers and you just squirt a little bit and turn your finger and it smells so good I love him so much and this birthday cake 1 it smells exactly like a sweet birthday cake the mango once once I give really nice juicy mango and the rose went smoothly really fresh Rose and I love them I love them all so much I definitely recommend going to go to check out glossier so
