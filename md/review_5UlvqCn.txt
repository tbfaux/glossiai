fourteencarrot reviews Solution by Glossier: well I used up another of the glossy a solution this isn't super polarizing product when it came out its work for some people skin it hasn't worked for others that really works for mine and I tried not reproducing it but my skin went to crap I was using actually another exfoliator and it just wasn't doing the trick I actually broke out a lot so I really like this product I use up another one and I repurchase it because maybe I'm addicted to maybe that's it but I really really love it so if you have wanted to try it you might give it a try glossy has a really good return policy if it doesn't work they refund you so we're at the shop
