emilydoes_makeup reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so fun fact I'm just wearing one products in my eyebrows right now it is glossier boy brow and Shake black this product is really lovely it's really volumizing and adds the perfect amount of fluff and hold your eyebrows without being thicker heavy the shape black I really like be cut whenever I'm not wearing anything in my eyebrows I think it adds a really good amount of definition and when I do for my eyebrows I like you the shade of brown but both are amazing and I highly recommend this product
