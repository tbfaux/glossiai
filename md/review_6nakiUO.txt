milamenges1 reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: hi guys this is the glossy a moisturizing Moon mask and I really recommend this product you put it on for 20 minutes which is kind of seems like a lot for wearing a mask but I found that it really does moisturize and hydrate your face and it feels kind of like a moisturizer when you're putting it on so I put on a lot but the packaging is really cute and overall I think it's a really good product
