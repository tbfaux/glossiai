alyssaholland reviews The Super Pack by Glossier: so I'm going to be reviewing this lip gloss that actually use pretty much every day and it's a glossier lip gloss and this like clear Shimmer and shade I believe called holographic so it's sometimes I'll put this lip gloss over like like Aquaphor of some kind of some kind of lip balm but it goes on super suit it doesn't really smell or taste like anything you know I mean but it looks super pretty and it'll last you long time doesn't just like come off in 2 seconds but as you can see it's pretty but yeah I definitely recommend any glossier lip gloss and general I just think they're really pretty but
