bella_shea reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: this is the glossier stretch concealer on the color light they actually just released it all new shade range so this is technically the older version but it is still the same formula this is why it looks like in the pot why it looks likes to watch on my wrist and see it's a very sheer coverage concealer but I do wear this every single day I really really like it and I definitely recommend it is buildable even though it is pretty sheer but it just Blends into the skin really nicely and looks very natural on
