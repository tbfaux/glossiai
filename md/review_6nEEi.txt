sweetlittleindulgences reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so this is the product from last year that I both love and hate at the same time I really liked it for the fact that it's very simple quick and easy to use and I get a lot of compliments when I use these but they don't last long and they are very very sheer so for that I don't like them so I went ahead and flush them in the back of my hand I have slip on the left and then Cub here on the right so they're both really so they're both really pretty colors but you do kind of have to build it up a lot and it doesn't really last very well throughout the day however these are very travel friendly and as I mentioned it's so quick to make a look with us so shout out to glossy a for turning me on to liquid
