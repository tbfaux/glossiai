beautybymonamarie reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: my local Ulta was having a sale on all their Flower Beauty Products so I wanted to take the opportunity to try the blush bomb in the shade cinnamon and let me tell you I've been using this for a few days now I'm just going to squeeze a little bit onto the back of my hand and this is like almost an exact soup for glossier cloud paint and those are like almost twice the price of these so I just tap it on with my ring finger and it looks crazy pigmented at first but it Blends out so beautifully do you see thatreally like if you don't want to commit to the price of glossy Cloud pants and you can find the Flower Beauty blush bombs I'm telling you it's like the same thing it's beautiful and it's so easy to apply
