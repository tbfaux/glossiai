kariseward reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey y'all so I just finished my live on body care and I just thought that I would just finish this look off with some cloth PA Cloud paint in Sparks it's so this one is like so pigmented but I thought I'd just put some more of my cheeks just like Seamus is very pigmented but I hope everybody had a good week and that I'm finished I like I talk like so much that I forget what I say sometimes you know but I hope that it was helpful when they do another one one that's more in-depth with other things and it's so cute
