butterandbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: all right now this is one of the two new shades as of December or late November or early December 2020 spark it is described as a bright Poppy I really like it if you watch the video before which is dawn it's a little bit too Orange from me and so this one looks intense but so I kind of tried to do more saturated to less that treated like this is a warm or ride that I can actually wear for someone was like cool toned skin so although doing that looks like this I'm going to put half on so you can see using a little bit and using your ring finger so it's the lightest and I go like this up the cheekbone and then I start blending and I'm going to lend this is a blended side finish the other one for me if you wondered why I go out my cheekbone one is kind of like a nice feature but also because if I do that I look very flushed
