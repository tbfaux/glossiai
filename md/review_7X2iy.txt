devinkielle reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: so I just cleanse with luscious Dark Angels and I am currently using the glossier mega greens Galaxy Pack it has like this creamy white clay avocado oil and it's supposed to toxify your pores draw any excess oil and then leave your skin with this velvety matte finish so I will show you when I rinse it off so I just rinse it off my skin is definitely Matt and it's really really soft but I don't think this shrink my pores as well as like the bioclarity clarifying mask that my style of that leaves me super not my pores are much much smaller after use but it did shrink them some I'm really oily and typically have large pores so be I love him is cancelled once I rinse off the Mega Galaxy Super Bowl
