CatLee reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I recently purchased the glossier balm.com and honestly I can say I've been very obsessed with these like I use these every day and I just picked my pocket my bag in my school uniform and I love them my favorite one is definitely the mango cuz I love the scent and even though it is connected but you honestly don't really see it it's like a really light Coral color but it's really nice super refreshing so I really suggest Barney's I got them in a set of 3 for $30 and to buy them single or $12 each will you be saving $6 to buy them as three when you can pick which ones they also have a bunch of other flavors sense and I really want to get all the other ones so thank you for watching bye
