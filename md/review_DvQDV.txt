jasmine_egly reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi so I got the one kid a little while ago and I've been using it every day and I absolutely love it it really helps my face and my acne and my face feels smoother than I've ever felt before and I really love it too because you don't need a whole lot of it compared to other products you just need a little bit and it gets all over your face and my face feels amazing after washing it and it feels even more amazing after using the priming moisturizer and I love the bomb.com and makes my lips feels so smooth and really helps whenever they're dried out and I definitely recommend local phase one kiss
