katiestark reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: I used to have really dry skin and this completely solve that problem for me I cannot recommend this moisturizer enough it's affordable and the packaging is super cute not to mention it gets the job done and it has a light lavender scent which I like as you can see I'm almost done with mine and I can't tell you how many of these are gone through but look at the amazing texture if so rich it just melt into the skin
