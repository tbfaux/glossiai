itsmariaa reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: everyone this is the glossier balm.com I have the original sense that it has no fragrance in it I'm not really impressed with this I think it's just a marketing Ploy the packaging is cute and there's nothing special about this in my opinion you might as well use Vaseline on the main ingredient is petrolatum in here I don't think anything really is spectacular about the brand it's just a marketing Ploy I rather use Burt's Bees and the ingredients are not and that they are cruelty-free like I said the packaging is cute there's nothing super-special about this product I don't recommend that you might as well get something from the drugstore that's just as effective or Not Butter
