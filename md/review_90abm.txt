allthedew reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: I want to do a quick review on the glossy Play Glitter jelly and fire walk with a shape I got just watch for the packaging cuz it's really nice this is it on the back of my hands really beautiful but I do think that it does need a basement music isn't in my tab your kind of patchy on the eyes and when I tried it I didn't notice it works way better with the glitter primer or not it's by itself cuz it's kind of like a gel-like slippery consistency which is kind of cool but it does slip inside without primer so I definitely think is needs a glitter primer as for the size it is kind of smalljust for comparison's sake this is colour-pop one yeah it is kind of small for the price and that is on the inside it is a really beautiful shayden really lesbianas how often do we use glitter is unless you live that life but I personally like to just bring it out on special occasion so this isn't that kind of person
