lonnekemckinney reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: hello so it's that I'm going to be reviewing the glassy eye Play Glitter jelly in the shade Bijou Bijou so this is described as a gunmetal glitter this is probably my second favorite out of the four to the jellies I really like it because the gel that it's in doesn't have a tint like Phantasm these two have like 18th to them but it's very pretty and I feel like it's very workable you can put it on top of any color eyeshadow and it's not going to like affect it unlike these two which will like 10th the eyeshadow a different color but yeah I really like Bijoux Bijoux and I really like the formula of all of the glitter jellies they don't flake noticed that they sleep all day
