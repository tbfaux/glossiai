sevillathalia reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: hey guys so I'm going to be reviewing the vanilla clip by Gracia play in the color Tawny so you get the color up again like this the color Pony is a pretty mavi pink I'm sorry my lips are a little cracked but here except what it looks like Lego as you can see it's pretty pigmented and it's really comfortable to wear on the lips it's the perfect no color so I really recommend you try it
