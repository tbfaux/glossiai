jannakrystal reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi so my second review up let's start again my second review of today is of the glossier balm.com I really like this one cuz you can use it on your lips cuticles elbows I use it on my hands to I've had it about like 2 months and I still have a lot of product left I typically use about this much so as you can see a little goes a long way I use it after my skincare routine so in the mornings and then at before going to bed it honestly works very well it's very light and I just I love
