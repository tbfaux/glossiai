esmerosy reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys, today I'm going to be doing a little mini review on the glossier cloud paint which is in color storm I absolutely love the stuff at first I was literally so unsure what it did but I've kind of concluded that it basically stings your skin can use as blush on you can use on your lips whatever so today in Shanghai looks so this is a very colorful like blush so that's why I mean he's on my lips as you can see doesn't even though stain on your finger however you can see how its pigments in my lips if I wipe know that comes off and it's very very good because I look gorgeous especially if I topped off with a gloss so yeah I really recommend
