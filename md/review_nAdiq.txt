amberboulder reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to be talking about glossy is let's start an herb let's start is a super shimmery eyeshadow and herb is one of my favorite color you can really see how deep and complex color is it's really beautiful but has this doe foot applicator and I like to apply I just doing one thought I would really custom lash line like that and then just blending it out with my finger so this is about the amount that I wear for my day today at 4 just a really subtle I'm Shimmer and boosting color to enhance my natural eye color another thing I love about it is how buildable it is so you can just really add more if you want a more deeply pigmented eyeshadow that also has a really great Shimmer yeah it's just another great product I left from glassy a super buildable really beautiful color that really just makes a lot of eye colors pop
