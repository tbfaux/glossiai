littlebuzz reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: real good morning I'm getting ready for work and just thought I would walk you through a couple parts of my routine by already color corrected and I'm going to use the glossier's stretch concealer I have it in the shade G11 and I really like it it's a pretty lightweight concealer I've been moving in so my under-eye bags are wild right now cuz I'm not getting any sleep I'm just unpacking boxes but you can see cuz I'm really smooth and even though it's really lightweight it does offer quite a lot of coverage. Go ahead and do it on my eyelids today to cuz I'm not wearing any eyeshadow and there you can see that difference in that brightening so sweet I love it check it out
