Haler124 reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: the guys so as I said in my last review I'm going to do a first impression review on the sample size of glossier's Milky jelly cleanser this came with another glossy a product I got with my super coins so my face is not wash right now so I'm going to wash it and then I'm going to be right back and tell you how it feels on my skin so I just moisturize after like usual and my skin didn't feel tight after and the consistency is like a jelly and honestly I really like it felt super moisturizing on my skin it did smell bad but that's fine because I know that glossy a is a clean simple brand so there's no added fragrances that's why I smell bad I actually think that it clean my skin pretty good without stripping it of its natural oils which I really liked about that so I think I'm going to check it out more I recommend this to everyone
