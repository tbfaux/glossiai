pergoddess reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: so prior to the facial spray I use the glossier priming moisturizer and this has been like the bomb.com over the aesthetic in the hyper blue STI but after actually using the product I can definitely say I would recommend I will give it a 10 out of 10 is great for sensitive skin I have combination oily skin so far I haven't had any problems this is like a OG and it's definitely a staple from here on out
