riyahtaylor reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: nudestix nudies Matt and Sunset Strip I'm pretty sure I've already made a review on this and for those that have been following me for a while I've actually been using this for almost as long as I've used cloutier's Cloud paint and it's just one that I trust you guys I have these in several Shades but right now I'm really loving Sunset Strip as you can see there's a thing here they're all multi-use products which is why I love cream blushes this shade in particular is kind of just like kind of coralie just more warm I think it's like the like ultimate summer type of shadehere's a Swatch I never apply it from the stick to my face that actually rub my fingers on there and then blend it out I just feel like when you applied with a stick it moves your foundation and other products here it is bonded out it's more of like a putter fan
