amyb7 reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: Sears glasses Cloud paint cream liquid blush and this goes for $18 I believe on glasses website and I absolutely love this place it's an everyday stable to me I love how easy it is to apply and spread I also love that glossier has so many color options of this product I do like this color a lot this is the shade puff and I'll show you guys how it looks but the only thing about this color I feel like it's almost a little too late for my skin cuz when I spread it out sometimes I realize that the more I spend it the more it almost like disappears but maybe that's just me I so love this product but next time I just made my goal for the Hazy Shade which is a bit darker darker but I do definitely recommend it definitely a staple for my everyday makeup routine I love it
