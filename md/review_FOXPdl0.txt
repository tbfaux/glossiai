theozhang reviews Niteshine by Glossier: am I using my cat food use again yes so today I'll be reviewing the glossy night shine in the Shade of Pale Pearl so this is what it looks like and then the one looks like it's just like a tiny doe foot applicator and yeah so here's what it looks like on so involve my glasses but so can comparison to the Halo scope it's much more pigmented with also a shimmery like the Halo scope the good thing about it is that so do we that looks like very natural noise until that your Highlander on versus this where is you can see it's like you can tell that Tyler was very much more Glam looking which I like it's good for certain occasions just Hill scoop I prefer for more dailies I really like it it's pretty
