lilyytay reviews Niteshine by Glossier: this is the brand new glossy play night shine highlighter in the shade platinum rose which I've been loving lately actually like this highlighter a lot more than glossies Halo scope since it's way easier to apply it has a little doe foot applicator and it's also a multi-purpose product since it works great as an eyeshadow base this is what the applicator looks like and here is a Swatch of the highlighter super pretty doing thing I wish is that this bottle was a little bit bigger since it's a little bit expensive for the amount of product you're getting but other than that I really love it
