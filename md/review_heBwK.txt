harmonym reviews Glossier You Perfume Solid fragrance compact and Glossier You eau de parfum by Glossier: okay so I know that in the picture it looks like I'm talking about the solid or the actual spray perfume but today I'm going to be time at the solid so comes in a cute little pink suede bag and the one thing that I always hate saying this cuz I feel stupid but one of the main reasons why I bought this house for the packaging has this like little twist top and its magnetic and the packaging is like really heavy and sturdy feeling but alongside the packaging I think that this is a well-performing perfume you know like liquid perfumes versus solid perfumes really are like different in the way that they can react with your skin differently so if you're not a solid perfume kind of person I wouldn't recommend this but I would recommend spending the $22 in order to see if you like this send rather than spending the $60 for the full bottle because any good to see if you like it and it smells amazing so
