jaidennhaggiag reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is a classy a lead star this is a cream eyeshadow that is metallic and sparkly and beautiful and I'm so excited to try with you guys this Shadow comes with a cute little sponge applicator can't forget about how cute this little tube is look at this packaging glossy always knows what they're doing but this in our lives now that we have the product on I'm just going to use a little brush to blend out the edges just left my Lids so beautiful and glossy ye no pun intended in all seriousness this is a very very sheer Shadow so if you're looking for something brighter or something more kind of Pop I guess you would really have to build this product
