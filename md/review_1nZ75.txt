sarahjgomez reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: so step 9 of my little I put on is vanilla clip now I already put the song because I already made the but it was glitching out so I'm just going to do this again and this in the shade disco it's described to be a high shine lacquer I don't think it's very high shine but it is shiny definitely not Matt super creamy no smell which I love but the clicker is a little bit of an issue as well as the puffs something I know for a fact it would end up clicking getting messy in the cat and the puff is just unclean look at it I heard he accidentally clicked it it's just messy and I always miss the cap and it's really dirty in there and that's what bothers me since I already accidentally clicked it there's so much for you it is pretty shiny it's really cute I definitely think you guys should go check these out and this is honestly just the perfect shade for me and really happy I got this
