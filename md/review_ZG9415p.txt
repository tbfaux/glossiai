teresapecher reviews Skywash by Glossier: hey guys so I have two products here first I have the glassy eye sky wash in the shade pool it's like the soft baby blue and then I also have the elf cookies and dreams no budget eyeshadow stick and this is in the shade Chill Zone and I really love the glossy I won but like I really just love the color and I love the matter of fact but it's such a tiny tiny tube and there's like barely any product in it and it's just too expensive so I was trying to find a doob so I found this at Walmart it's the elf version way-way cheaper and it's also summer blue Shades I'm going to go ahead and do like a side-by-side comparisonokay so this is the glossy eyesight and this is the elf side it's so obviously this is two layers after drying of the glossy I want and this is the elf one literally so potent so much better it's like five bucks is 18 like the difference is obvious that definitely
