thatgoodglow reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so at the very last thing that I put on right before I go to bed is the glossier balm.com calm down. Calm I'm universal skin South I have it in the flavor coconut it smells amazing with the packaging is just so cute I can't get over glossy a I know they're super hyped but this stuff really does hydrate my lips I'll wake up in the morning and I still feel moisturizer my lips which is super rare I don't feel it drying out my lips like CarMax another Chopsticks so I do really enjoy that and then with the leftover product I honestly just rub it into my hands if I have dry Knuckles I'll use it on my Knuckles to Super hydrate creates a really good barrier on your lip to protect them and trapping moisture and so I really think that this product is worth your money
