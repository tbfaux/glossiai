amyb7 reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: today I'll be reviewing gloves to use milk jelly cleanser this cleanser goes for $18 in the size but it also has a smaller size which goes for $9 and for $18 you get 6 fluid ounces overall I really like this cleanser especially for the night time because it has a very nice creamy consistency show you guys the consistency here but this very creaminess allows you to like easily melt away your makeup at night which is really nice and it just feels it feels really smooth and nice on the skin the only thing I would say is that for super super sensitive skin super sensitive skin and give me like a mild burning sensation sometimes but besides that if you have less sensitive skin I would totally go for this concert
