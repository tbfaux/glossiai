thekristynedit reviews Niteshine by Glossier: hey guys so the product that I chose for the zodiac sign Libra which is what I am September 30th if you didn't know this is the glossier play night shine a highlighter in the shade pale Pearl but obviously any shade work this is just a shade that IHOP the reason that I chose this for us Libras is because we are very bubbly very charismatic very social people and I feel like having like a little late float or skinned makes me feel a little cute just kind of odd that like Finishing Touch to take a lip gloss for your face you know and I'm always rocking the class but I think the Highlight is just like a very cute non-sticky way to just look very slowly and fresh so yeah I think that you're leaving you would love this it makes me feel super cute and I absolutely love it
