legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: taste great so this is Klaus a boy proud and I had the shape I have the shade of black so I don't have anything on my brows yet so I thought I'd show you guys as I put this phone I absolutely adore this mascara I usually find Brown mascara don't really do much for my brows cuz I don't have a very sparse brows but this one I absolutely love so I definitely start by wiping off any excess and then I just go in with it I really like the light gray of this a definite looks a lot more natural than say the usual brown ones that I would have to use since I have dark browsso this doesn't have the hold power of a brow wax but I'm still very happy with it definitely still manages to push up my eyebrows and my brows are truly so I definitely I just like how it adds a little bit of color in a little bit of lift
