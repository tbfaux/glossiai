FootprintsbyDianna reviews Lidstar by Glossier: I've recently added to my makeup collection glasses lives star in the color Cub which is this copper glittery one and the color Lily which is this Violet won both are such a necessary part of my Pro kit I honestly love these two I could use them alone on my leg when I have the need to run out the door quickly or I can use this to highlight and eyeshadow on my eyelid to just brighten up a look I enjoy both of them because they do not budge once the product drives onto your eyelid or wherever you put it on your face it does not budge it does not blend so just be aware of that which I'm completely okay cuz I'm the type who will wear my makeup all day long and all days about 16 hours so I need Cosmetics to stay on for a long time and this does it
