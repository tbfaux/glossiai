maiswillis reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: this lip gloss is my Harley Graham that blows the original Club Penguin oh my God it just in my opinion is the best clear gloss out there it is not sticky but holds your hair doesn't get stuck in there anything you always feels quite like moisturizing it reflects light as well say it from every angle it's just pulp and it's so good
