karsyn467 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys to family talk about the phone. Calls were going to see her so I got the coconut balm and mint balm and I also got the birthday cake bomb but it's not with me it's time so in my opinion are very nourishing help with dry lips they really like like make it softer and I smell really good so I guess he's a 10 at 10
