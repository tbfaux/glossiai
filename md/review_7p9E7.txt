sevillathalia reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: this is the milky oil makeup remover from glass E8 first of all the packaging is super cute you have to shake it so all the ingredients correctly I use it with all types of makeup event makeup that is hard to remove and it works really well I usually use a Q-tip so I don't waste much product I will say the bottle is very tiny and for the prize you're not getting a lot of product there are other makeup removers that are much cheaper and help a lot more productso yeah it works great but it's pretty expensive for what you get
