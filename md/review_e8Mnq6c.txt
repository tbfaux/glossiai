buriiana reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hey guys it's Brianna here and I'm here to talk about the glossy a milky oil waterproof makeup remover I've been using this religiously ever since I received it in my Ipsy Glam Bag plus I just apply some of it to a cotton pad and I let the product work its magic it really just dissolves your makeup really effortlessly I also like that even though it's oil-based it doesn't leave your skin feeling super oily which I hate your skin feels refreshed soft and you're ready to continue with the rest of your skin care routine like cleansing toning moisturizing all that good stuff so definitely check this out this is the only glossy a product that I own but I'm super impressed like I said I use it just about everyday to remove my makeup it just makes my skin care routine that much easier so definitely check this product out
