harmonym reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: now while I have talked about the glossy balm. Comes in general I'm here on my whatever you call this I have a total of four of them but I did just want to make a separate review talking about the midline because this has been my all-time favorite although these are basic although they're basically just has to leave I think that this was extra special for stuff I love the scent it's like sweet mint it's not to peppermint it's not to anything and the thing and I like about this is that it is a little spicy it's a little minty it does tingle a little bit and I just overall I like this one a lot more than the mango more than the birthday cake more than the rose I like the rose but I just think that this son is not too overpowering it's fairly natural smelling and it's not too sweet it's not too intrusive and it's actually just really Cooling and ice on the lips for when your lips are chapped
