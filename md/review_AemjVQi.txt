Emma_mwah reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: alright these are the bomb.com this I have the rose balm.com the birthday balm.com in the mint balm.com and these are really amazing Chopsticks they really moisturizing and they really help make your lips are all nice and smooth I know see the birthday one comes with sparkles in it so that's really fun and then the rose ones probably my favorite it has a little pink Sheen to it almost I know they have other like sense that also have a little Sheen so definitely recommend that and I love these a lot they are a little pricey for Chopstick I will say that they're like $12 but they're honestly pretty worth it because they're really good I always have one of these on me I keep one of my school bag and keep it in my purse I keep going with me everywhere so yeah once you go black CA you probably won't go back
