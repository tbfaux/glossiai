ariannaa reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: so I wanted to kind of get my review on galante's at stick because I've seen a ton of reviews that are pre- and a ton of reviews are really good so I had it right there in right here on the side movie and I've been used it for 2 days and now it's there's no scarring which is something I've dealt with like the brown spot is left there's one of my finger right now I can't get rid of sound I would give it a 9 attend because it doesn't smell either try like a lot
