saigexcout reviews Futuredew by Glossier: all right so I'm going to review the glossy a future do it's an oil serum hybrid and let me just say before I start this that first it was a little bit skeptical because it made my face oily but after about three to five minutes of application it like becomes like this Natural Glow and it's super pretty self so I like I just some people say that the consistency of this is like really sick and yes that's true but it's like it just kind of Blends out and it's just super hydrating and soft on your face my face feels so soft it feels like a newborn baby's face and I used to have really bad acting like all of my forehead but I started using my moisturizer and then putting that on after it's just it's amazing I highly recommend
