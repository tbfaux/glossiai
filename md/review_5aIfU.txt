fourteencarrot reviews Colorslide by Glossier: next up let's talk about the color slide liner this is the color jumbo which is this beautiful curity orange which I was excited about because I love orange on my face with my red hair as you can see I have it on I just swiped it above and below I also use the the color BRAC just to ground the color so it wasn't too orange and made me look washed out here is a Swatch the texture of the liner is so smooth it Glides right on and it's super pigmented there's you don't have to press very hard it's really gentle on your eyelid overall I really love this liner I'm excited to try other colors I do have three I might try a couple more but in for the price for $15 compared to like the Marc Jacobs I think it's I could buy
