thekristynedit reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: so their spray moisturizer is a product that I really really wish works for me but unfortunately it just doesn't feel like I said unfortunately this product is really does not work for me I have very dry and sensitive skin and this makes me break out in these weird little like red bumps all over my face and also really burns my skin I know there's some ingredient in here that's like a retinol or like acid or something that just like I said really does not work well with my skin but if you don't have sensitive skin in this may really work for you I just find that the price point is extremely high for the quality of it and like I said it makes my skin hurt my cat is playing with a pumpkin that I bought him if y'all want to see this is ridiculous my room is a mess but like okay so sorry to hear that but anyways I don't like this you may work for you if you don't have sensitive skin but for me it is a pass though sorry glassy-eyed
