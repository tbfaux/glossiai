emilyyy reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: are we going to talk more about the glossier lip gloss I think I talked to her before this is a chance. I want to also have the holographic when I really don't even know where it is right now the last time I talked about the clear one yeah I'm the holographic tonight yeah I don't even know where I put it because I lost it the packaging in the Box I'm very basic looking lip gloss just looks like this is a good clear pinkish tone so she opened it up how's it going little instead of what I don't really know I don't even know like the names of the things but it has a really nice applicator and it's like a flat kind of thing and applies really well it's like a bit sticky is it a waxy texture kind of but this down really well
