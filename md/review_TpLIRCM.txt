Mileyy reviews Glossier Perfecting Skin Tint G5 is a warm deep shade 1 fl oz / 30 ml by Glossier: hi super great so I'm going to tell you guys about the glossier skin tint so I got this like a couple days ago and I would say I would wear more like those two days but I will say that's kind of oily like I'm not really but it's like really liquidy I will show you guys so you just says you can talk to me like ghosts on your face up really fast can you get seeds really cover that much but it does cover a little bit to really like cover but I mean even though it's like really like watery I really recommend it's really nice I love the ball at super cute and yeah I just like how it feels like really lightweight here's the bottle really cute I would recommend it
