ontheglowNYC reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: so you got bubble wrap the date came out at the glossier flagshipI've been testing out for a few days under my eyes and also my lips cuz that's what it's for it's basically just super hydrating it's not for dark circles or anything but as just an everyday regular ice cream I think it's pretty good and Lift Cream also my skin is not the best because it's finals time but it'll be over soon since it's very hydrated definitely
