_emilymarie reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so my favorite mascara is glossier lash slick Sephora glossier lash slick was made I didn't really wear mascara because all of the mascaras on the market just made my eyelashes look too clumpy or spiders or honestly just too intense and I never wanted that kind of look just like all of glassy eyes out of makeup lash slick is definitely like a no makeup makeup and it's perfectly no makeup looks and I love this I love the bristles are like Silicon and they really catch and crab all your lashes and really separate them and just make them longer and you also see what it looks like on so here's one of my eyes with lash slick I just love it because it's supernatural and it's just honestly better than any mascara I've tried
