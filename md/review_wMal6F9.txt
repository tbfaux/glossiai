devinkielle reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: hi it's been awhile with all the things going on in the world I just haven't felt like doing reviews just being honest but I wanted to get back into them today I just woke up and felt like I should go do some things so we're going to start with the classy a supervillain Sturm it is a hyaluronic acid serum when glossier's sent me the skincare edit stuffy that little gift they gave up little kid that they sold around holiday the supervisors included in it and I have to say I think this has been making a huge difference in my skincare routine lately it's probably like step 7 in my routine or 8 but I missed my face first and Tyler on an acid cleans to moisture and then I've had it in and let it air-dry and as an oily girl I definitely think it's made a difference in keeping me less oily throughout the day it's super hydrating
