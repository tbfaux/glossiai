jannakrystal reviews Futuredew by Glossier: so this is the glossy a oil serum hybrid I got it in there skincare edit kit I think it's called and this is like the mini size if I'm not mistaken it's 0.5 Oz and you really only need a little bit so this is a really hydrating products so is very heavy so you might break out a depends on your skin I don't break out but I like to use it on days when I know it's going to be like really cold and dry weather orjust when I want to feel like Dewey so I used it today I use about half a pump or maybe one I don't use the two pumps like it says on the directions because I feel like it's too much for my skin it's really good I suggest you try it if you're interested
