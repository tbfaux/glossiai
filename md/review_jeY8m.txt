vegamfrancine reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: today I'm using glossier Cloud paint which is one of my favorite product and this is a creamy gel blush and it looks Supernatural in the cheeks it's very pretty my favorite color is buff and I really like mixing stuff with a bit of Dusk and it makes a beautiful Dusty pink rose kind of shade which looks very pretty this is what it looks like mixed and on the cheek you just blend and that's it
