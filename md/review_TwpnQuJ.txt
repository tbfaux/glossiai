flowerlife reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hi I'm just saying okay so I avoid bro on my eyebrows right now and it is amazing I just have white brown and the saint Luxe brow gel and it really at the right amount of color to like this in hairs at the front and it doesn't necessarily like keep them in place that's why I use a different brow gel but it's amazing at making them like colored and I personally really like it also I have shade and even though I have light brown hair the brown is stupid too dark for me so yeah
