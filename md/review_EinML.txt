elflan reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: sun coming at you again with another glossier product honestly I'm such a glossy or who it's kind of ridiculous they should make me a rap but this is the stretch concealer I use the shade light it looks so natural on the skin like I literally love it so much this is not like a super full coverage concealer but it's not going to dry you out it's creamy and like I just look so pretty I love it so much is the only concealer I found that doesn't make me look like Katie or gross or anyting like I like you to still be able to see my freckles on a little bit Acme like it's cute I need we're all just humans like skin is skin it's beautiful so you should show it up
