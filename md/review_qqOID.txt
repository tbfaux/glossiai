galenjessop reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: say I'll be reviewing the glossier coconut balm.com I absolutely love this product I have so many of these I haven't met one literally sitting right there it's so moisturizer and it heals all of my dry lips I totally think it's worth the $12 it also especially this one because it's mildly tended works really well too much rides other parts of your body such as cracked elbows or cracked but cuticles and I just love this so much
