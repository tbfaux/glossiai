lacyp reviews Generation G by Glossier: salmon to be reviewing jenerationdiy bossy a and Light really cute as always like law CA does this one is supposed to be kind of like a light pink like a coffee pink which it is but I feel like it's a little bit darker than that like that it looks online I thought it was going to be lighter but it's definitely darker and I feel like you don't need to apply a lot to get the color that you want so that's kind of cool about that and it is a sheer matte so which is my favorite kind I really really really love this color here is a Swatch that was just a couple swipe so again you really don't need that much to get the color
