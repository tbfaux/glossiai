yolk reviews Generation G by Glossier: okay my love for looking a lot better today compared to yesterday but I want to do a review on the generation G lipstick and the color fuzz and it's been quite some time since I last use generation G and this was a long time ago when their packaging was just crap the color I had back then was I think jam and Leo so it's been a long time coming and I've been using this ever since I got it which was yesterday and I really love the color it's this really nice like Rosie light taupe color and the sons of it smells like roses it's really nice Stila matte lipstick while also being hydrating I'd like to put a lip balm over this or underneath this generation gee has come a long way and I like it I want to get the color of mulch next
