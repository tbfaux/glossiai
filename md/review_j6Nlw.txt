dewyinthedesert reviews Generation G by Glossier: hi guys today want to come in here and talk to you about coffee is Genji so with me I do have the old packaging and the new packaging my old packaging cracked on the top so they did send me a new one in the old packaging it's all plastic the top cracks really easy and I heard a lot of people had problems with the product falling out in the old packaging I have the shade cake I also have it in the new packaging in the old packaging you get to grams and the new packaging you get 3-g so I really like that here is the new packaging it's a lot thicker of a tube and when you open it up the tube is metal holds the product a lot better and it feels a lot more secure and just heavy so I don't really like that about it as well here is with the shade cake looks like on it can be a little bit drying so sometimes I like to lay it with a lip balm by the shades are really beautiful they give you kind of like a blotted sheer look over all I would really recommend it I like the Genji's other than the little bit of a drawing effect
