elaineeverett4 reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: this is glossier perfecting skin tint in the shade light and I've had this for a while this is the old reformulation but this stuff feels really good it gives a little Duty glow it's very natural it doesn't have much of a tint to it just a little bit it definitely makes my skin just look better it doesn't cover up blemishes doesn't really cover up your imperfections but you can use stretch concealer for that also I'm going to show you how it looks like on the inside as you can see as you can see it's pretty liquidy so it kind of mimics my natural skin tone started bonded out you can only see it very well not sure this is the greatest greatest example my SPF. I would definitely recommend for light coverage
