hannahbeauty reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: so this is the new glossier body hero exfoliating bar this is what the product looks like I probably used it a couple times and it really is just kind of a bar soap with exfoliating granules in it it smells good it's like they're classic body hero send which I guess I'll say his grown on me but I am a fan of law CA and I needed a new body scrub so I wanted to pick this up I also thought that their WNBA campaign was really really lovely I love that they had female athletes is kind of the face of this launch so I grabbed it and I will say I hope that this would have been more kind of like an oil in a bar form which is what I thought it would be and it really is more of a bar so so this does exfoliate my skin it leaves my arms very smooth but it leaves them all so what kind of whip out like squeaky clean feeling and then I have to go in with moisturizer later so I would like if they would reformulate this product but it's not a bad by just
