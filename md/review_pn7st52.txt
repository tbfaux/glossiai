Lia_reviews reviews Glossier set Lip Gloss and Lash Slick by Glossier: okay and so this part is going to be the review of the glossier lip gloss so put it on so it is a very glossy as well this one goes a little bit easier it's more of a sticky consistency do brush is small and you can get a lot of product on as well but I feel like that's the same for this one so yeah I'm going to do with the combination video in this one cuz they're not to make three size-wise this one is bigger but I've had this product since Christmas it's half the size and I haven't used it all but that's probably cuz like I don't know I stop wearing my boss to school okay so price-wise this is $3 and this is $14 this one is thinner and goes on easier and this one isn't super thin it's Pretty stinking glossy I personally like them the same but if you're looking for a new lip gloss I would go with this one it's cheaper and this exact same
