tru_beauty reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: Kate today I'm going to review glossier priming Moisturizer in my opinion I've always hated moisturizers for the face I am always afraid of breaking out and just my skin feeling so oily and I just hate that feeling this does not do that it makes my skin feels so soft while not feeling greasy or oily at all and I just feel like my skin is like velvet when I put this on this is the perfect two on one if you trying to prime your makeup and also be moisturized at the same time and perfect for the winter as it's really cold out and your skin can get really dry he's got a lot of good ingredients in here. Hyaluronic acid which makes your skin really nice and hydrated and then it's got an anti redness complex with tea and honey extracts to reduce the redness and I have a lot of fat it's also very buildable so if you want more hydration just lay it on
