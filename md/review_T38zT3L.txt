pergoddess reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so I'm super excited I just recently Ortiz's giving out I just recently ordered the glossier stretch concealer and I got it in the shade G4 so I just love the packaging always go see as always so aesthetically pleasing and it's really heavy really weighty and as I said before I got the ecology for now when I first opened it I felt like it wasn't really mine shame but after watching it on my skin and trying it out I think this color is perfect so after few days of wearing it I can't wait to come back and let you guys know my full thoughts
