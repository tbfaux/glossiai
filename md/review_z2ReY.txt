clairewalter reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: I don't usually wear face makeup because I love the look of skin I like texture I like the different tones that come through but sometimes if I'm a little more red or if I'm going to put powder on top I use the glossier perfecting skin tint the coverage is really light so I know that a lot of people don't love it because of that but that's exactly why I love it I use the medium shade and I just rub it in with my fingers because I'm lazy and it looks just as good and there you go it's the perfect amount of coverage for someone who likes to look of skin but once a little bit more of a smoother and more even look for the day I don't recommend it if you're looking for heavy heavy coverage or something to cover up pores or bumps it it it just won't do that
