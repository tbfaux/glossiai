latimelessangel reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: hi such today I will be talking about the glossy a rich primer moisturizer and pretty much what I have to say about this product is I use it every morning after I wash my face and after I use my toner water from Lush and to apply it all you have to do is just get like your finger is getting it a little cream on your fingers and I pretty much what they do is they start with under my eyes cuz I have really dark circles and I pretty much just spread it out and just rub it all over my faceI'll make sure and get every inch and what's really great about this moisturizer is it's a good it's also a primer so you can use it with any of your makeup and I just like it because I'm literally makes my skin feel like velvet I'm not joking and yeah it just literally so smooth
