kateglavan reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys this today I'm going to be reviewing Cloud paint by glossy I'm sure you guys are aware of this product it is a liquid blush that comes in a ton of shade so today going to be using these two so the darker read a storm and then the PJs one is dusk so I love application of this and I have had some Claude pains for over a year and the bottle still really full like this thick and honestly you don't even need more than that like that might be too much for today and I loved it because all you do is you dab on and then you totally blend with your fingers which is like so easy for me and you totally just stab with two fingers and now I'm going to go in with the other shade I love to layer my cloud pants and I think it had so much depth to my face and I really love having rosy cheeks I feel like that's my perfect makeup look and so that's the look I really love how God paint supply and I totally suggest you guys go get your hands on some guy
