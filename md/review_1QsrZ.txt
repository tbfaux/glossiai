marcelaillustrates reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hi friends today I want to review the glossier lidstar in the shade van I'm really not a fan of the lettered versions of this product however the darker versions are just beautiful let me switch this for you okay so this is just one swipe of the product like you as you can see it's really shimmery it's so beautiful I really found that if you blend it with your fingers the pigment will go away for a little bit but if you blend it with the Project's going to look almost like this just a blind person so definitely blends with a brush unless you which is when I really slow glow but yeah I would really really recommend this product it's so beautiful
