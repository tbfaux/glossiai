elaineeverett4 reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so now I'm going to be reviewing the glossier boy brow and the shades clear and brown and this boy brow the formula is really good it's not clumpy it's not sticky it feels right now but has a natural hold which I really liked and that's kind of unique about lots of brow gels to compare it with a Pixi brow gel like the square one to my CLEAR pixie I would say that it's pretty similar this one has a smaller applicator and I think this one has a little bit of a finer stroke so your lashes may look a little more natural with this one the glossy a I definitely recommend they have lots of Shades they have clear brown black and give me up in Auburn Shake too so I wish they would expand their shade range a little bit but overall this is a really good stuff brow gel
