pergoddess reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: so the third SPF is the SPF Five Below Sierra and it is the Invisible Shield daily sunscreen SPF 35 sorry I didn't mention probably though I think I did in the first one will probably not the second one if you click the product data let you know the number of SPF and this one is honestly one of my face if you can see is more of a clear color versus the cream and is also pretty thick as you can see is not sliding anywhere but this one also doesn't leave a cast in my opinion is super hydrating and I love that this one also has a good smell that I appreciate this one I like better for the summertime like when I'm going to the beach even though it's not super super high in SPF I don't know just something about bringing this one to the beach with me that does it for me it smells really good and I feel like it sticks after being in the water as well so love that
