sophiedoublef reviews Generation G by Glossier: hey guys what's up today I just put on my lipstick glossy 8th generation G in color in the shade sip I love how it looks on my life totally like it but what I don't like about this product even though they have a new formula this is the old one just like plastic and the packaging looks heavier it's actually heavier and bigger I don't love this product because it doesn't last that long on my lips it falls really really easily it dries a little bit of my lips I'm going to try to use um Lenny's flea bomb sleeping mask before if it lasts longer but I don't I don't really love these product
