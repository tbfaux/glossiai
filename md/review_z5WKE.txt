allthedew reviews Colorslide by Glossier: so this is the new glossy play color slide in the shade pretty penny I'm actually very picky with eyeliner so I was kind of hesitant to get it but I decided to just go for it and try it out I tried it the first day I know is that I was very very creamy and very easy to apply barely any pressure whatsoever and it did last all day it didn't smell like and I really really like that because that normally happens to me this is a shit on my hands so you guys can get a little bit of an idea it's very pretty House of sparklesthe really pretty copper shaver she's appropriately named then as you can see I have been using it so yeah I'm really liking it and I do recommend it even though I do think it is a little pricey for an eyeliner it says what it was going to do so
