laylaforaker reviews Colorslide by Glossier: CS2 this is my view of the color slide on eye pencil in Candyland so I put more of the lipgloss on and actually like it it smells so good this one is in that blue packaging so this you can't see what like the product looks like until you open these so it's kind of like a really nice surprise this looks so pretty this is actually really nice so as you can see it's the pencil Swatch right there it's really pretty I like how this looks a lot I'm actually going to use that I'm going to put it underneath my eyes I don't know if you guys can see it that well but it's still really pretty I love the shade so much and yeah
