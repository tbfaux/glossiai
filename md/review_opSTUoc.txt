samcsanon reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: good morning let's talk about a cult favorite you can't even see that we're talking about the bomb.com with me right now I have the rose balm.com and the mint balm.com two of my favorites glossy advertises these as a universal skin Salve meaning that you can use this on your cuticles on your ashy knees or elbows anywhere you see the bomb.com like the mint and the birthday are recommended to only use on your lips because they can leave a tent or a little weird feeling on your skin anywhere else overall I enjoy these products cuz I get them for free I would never pay for them
