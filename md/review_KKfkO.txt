mariahrnorth reviews Generation G by Glossier: so I know I've done a review on this generation G lipstick from glossy a before it was my first reviews but I also use a filter on that review because I was a newbie and I was just starting out and I put filters on my reviews but anyway you couldn't really get a feel for the true color of this Genji because I put a filter in it so this is the shape cake I've had this since Christmas and I put a little bit on already but it's I was hoping it would be more oranges and it is because I'm really into peachy orange lipstick color so I don't wear this every day it's a little darker than I wanted to be but I now use less than I was using my first got it so now I just kind of like dabbing on instead of making layers and layers of buildable color so that is something that's awesome. Best is that it's super buildable and you can kind of pick what she
