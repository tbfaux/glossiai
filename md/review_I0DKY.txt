amudaus reviews The Playground by Glossier: hey guys so I'm going to be reviewing the playground set from glossier's play he died so the first product of going through viewing is the glossy play night shine and I got it any color pale Pearl this highway is definitely a more natural highlights if you really like natural highlights this is the product and it has a little bit of Shimmer the next product I have is the color slide and I got this in the color BRAC and this is the sharpener that comes with it product applied really smoothly and I'm super duper buttery and looks really nice
