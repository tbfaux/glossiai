discobeautie reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: glossier lash slick is like my everyday go to you I don't have any mascara on right now so just show you and it's feeling like an everyday wear this is what the I want to be able to see that but it's not like a super Fireberry brush it's more like a synthetic plastic brush which I like because I like the fibers will it come off on my eyelashes so it's a supernatural I haven't like done anything to my lashes or anyting just to show you like a little bit of like what one car would be I think I need to buy a new bottle to that's how much I've used it but it's more just like a natural look like it's not super dramatic LOL it's more so just like an everyday throw it on which is kind of what I would use it more for than like a glamorous like going out look you know but I like it and it stays on all day and it doesn't get crusty so
