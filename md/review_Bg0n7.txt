JayciNicole reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: last thing I came in my coffee I talked to today was a boy brow so I have previously review this I'm pretty sure but I have the color brown before or brunette or whatever it is I decided to try to get it cuz it wasn't my favourite I feel like it kind of made my eyebrows look chalky in a way but I tried the clear now and I'm obsessed I think it looks so so good it was really easy to use and ride down really well but doesn't like feel weird so I mean for me this is a lot better than the formula that has color added to it because now I'm I'm dying my eyebrows and then just putting this over-the-top mises so easy cuz you a perfect feathered brow look I'll have to try it as well with like more of asculpted brow I guess would be the word but yeah super duper in love with this so far so really happy
