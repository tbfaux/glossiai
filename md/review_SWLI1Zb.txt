gabil reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: all right I'll be reviewing the glossy lip gloss in clear so the packaging is really basic but I like it cuz it's very sleek and I love little foamy applicator at the end I don't know where it really would have call it and this comes in three colors clear which is the one I'm holding right now holographic and ride which bread to me is more of a pinkish color and holographic has glitters in it but I have this one so I really like this one cuz it doesn't feel sticky when you put it on your lips a lot of lip glosses do and well it just has like a shrine that I haven't seen with any other lip glosses I'm not sure if you can see that but this is what it looks like nice watch it on my wrist
