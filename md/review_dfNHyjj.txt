nizhani reviews Balm Dotcom, Birthday by Glossier: hi guys back at it again with the new swag I have had this for a long time there was something about my lip products that I never finished them because I'm always trying something else because my lips are so dry it is disgusting. Brush my teeth are used actually sabali lip scrub and the Bali bomb but the Bali bomb while it would probably be perfect for most people I have crusty crusts like when I say Krusty I got a zombie lips okay and so I use this the kind of seal it in it's got a cute little Sparkle it obviously has more than enough product to last you and that's the way it smells really good so I really recommend it especially if you have dry ass lips like me
