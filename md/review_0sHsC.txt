howdoyouglow reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I have a few of the bossy of bomb.com sorry it's going to be quite a bit dirty but they're not that great I think in the beginning I kind of fell for the hype and I was like yeah they're amazing but once I think about it like and I use my other lip balms that I love so much more they kinda don't compare I do think men is the best out of all of them cuz I think it gives a little more hydration but I feel like you're just putting flavored vaseline on your lips and I don't really think it's too big much so I did I even gave away like one of mine that I bought my sister cuz I don't like the sun and also it wasn't doing anything so I didn't need to keep that but yeah I actually wouldn't recommend me they think they're a lot better but bombs for cheaper
