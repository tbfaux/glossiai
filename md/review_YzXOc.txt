fourteencarrot reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay quick review of my all-time favorite blush in the whole world clown Paint & Dawn which is the bright orange and I am obsessed for me being a redhead finding a lash that makes you look alive and fresh is a big deal and I was shocked when this was my became I go to blush shade so I have it on here you can see it doesn't look super orange on the skin but it looks like you're alive and you know like you just got done with work out or something it just looks really fresh and pretty I love the texture I know some people have had problems blending this but I think if you just play with it and work with it you know for a while you'll get the hang of it just a little dab'll do ya blend into it helps if your skin is fresh and dewy on dry skin is definitely more difficult but I would recommend this absolutely there's a shade for everybody
