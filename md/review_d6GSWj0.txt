kelsbeaut reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: I'm also going to go in with my glossier stretch concealer it's into g12 which I believe is her lightest shade I have done a pretty good amount of damage to it but I want to see how long you should have it I just really like to put it right here where I have like those lines for my bags are starting and then put a little bit up this way too stretched out when be right back that's a good job like making sure things like bright and awake and stuff the right thereHarry seems to like little scoop we also works really well for National prime rib be looking for that but yeah
