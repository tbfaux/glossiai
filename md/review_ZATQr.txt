tru_beauty reviews Generation G by Glossier: you guys are arguing glossy 8th generation G lipstick which I got from super great with my points and thank you so much for that super great I am speechless about their new packaging glossy really stepped out this time it's just so shiny and sleet on the outside I'm shook I got it in cake and it smells really like like perfumy almost it's a sheer lipstick that is very buildable and lightweight and here's how it looks washed on my hand is definitely very light at first you really have to keep going to get a true color to come out very peachy I like it I'm going to try it on my lips here's how it looks built up it's very lightweight the formulas nice and I love this color it's a nice everyday color that I can wear
