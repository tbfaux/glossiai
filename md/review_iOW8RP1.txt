I got I think a year ago and I'm literally obsessed with glossy I literally almost all of their products and I love all of these days I'm going to show you that his face swap face wash I use it usually in the shower that's why I kind of looks like this but I use it in the morning it's it's very like a hydrating and it leaves my skin feeling super smooth and it smells really good moisturizer only use this in the morning since it's a priming moisturizer and it's really thin which I like and I think this is a really great moisturizer for people who have a normal to end my combo skin which is what I have so yeahBosley's probably one of my favorite lip balms ever I own so many of their bomb.com but this one's definitely my favorite it smells absolutely amazing and I've pretty much use the whole thing but yeah it's kind of a 10 recommend all three of these products the Skin Care set
