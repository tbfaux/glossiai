ariannakm reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys so this is cheat sheet by Maybelline I do believe it is a new product it is in the shape of a flame I do have it on right now keep in mind I don't have any foundation any skin tint any powder on my face right now but as you can see it's very light pink very beautiful it as a very healthy glow to your face if you just want to put this on with some mascara for natural that would be beautiful but I'm sure you can also layers on with like Foundation or skin tint and also for more pigment you can just put more layers but honestly the consistency is upper lip gloss it's so beautiful 10 out of 10 recommend this product and honestly it's like glossier Cloud paint but so much less expensive and we all love a good deal so check it out it's honestly really great and here's another look there's also different Sheets if you want to work or pink but totally recommend
