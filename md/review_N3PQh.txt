latimelessangel reviews Solution by Glossier: hi so I will be reviewing the glossy a solution exfoliator and pretty much what I do is I use it every morning after I wash my face so all you have to do is just take like a pump or too I do too and just like rub it all over your face after you've washed it of course and honestly I'm going to have to save that it really does help my skin and it really helps get rid of any blemishes or any uneven bumps that I have on my face because I have eczema and you know usually I have like these kind of tiny bumps but I've been using the solution for aboutfelt like a month now after like I used to use it and as you can see my Skin's pretty even so I have to give this product 5 out of 5 stars because like look at this
