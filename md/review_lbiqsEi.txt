kaiviolet reviews Futuredew by Glossier: hey what are you doing I'm going to be viewing the future due by glassy-eyed so my first impression is that it has Blake packaging and it's like super pretty looking like it's whatever and so we're going to try it out so this is what it looks like I just got on my desk for this but that's what it looks like nice and like shimmery that's what it's like to be on as you can tell and if you're going for the clan grow up I think this is going to work for you but it's not my favorite and it smells a little bit weird like maybe like manure it which is kinda gross but not overpowering so I give this a 7 out of 10 by
