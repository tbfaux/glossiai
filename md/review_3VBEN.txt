amudaus reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to be reviewing the eagle LA CA perfecting skin tint I use this product every single day I don't really like how Foundation sits on my skin to skin tones I normally go for I think this is really nice if you don't want to wear makeup like a no makeup day but you want to look a little bit nicer or if you just don't like Foundation like me definitely recommend this product so this is super sheer curtains and it basically just help even out your skin tone kind of reduces little bit of redness and it just makes your skin really do we as well this contains Diamond powder which helps with brightening and blurring and glycerin which attracts and retains moisture in the house is water consistency that blends to a really nice dewy finish
