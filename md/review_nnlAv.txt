josbiv reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is classic with star and cub and I've heard that a lot of people don't like this because it's so subtle but I'm really basic with my eyes shut as I usually do one color across the letter one color in like a little darker in the crease it works really well for what I use it for the applicator kind of looks like a lipstick so I just willed a bit on my eye and then blend it with my finger in the trick with this is not to blend too much I just kind of like a dab it out a little bit people complain about this because if you mess with it too much it like disappears but if you really Master just like dabbing on you can still get a good like color payoff I love it honestly and it doesn't crease it doesn't like go away during the day like it'll look like this for the rest of the day
