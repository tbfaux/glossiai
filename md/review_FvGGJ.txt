Lai2ly reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: play so this is me glossy a berry bomb.com and it is amazing it smells so so good kind of like a pie it's just kind of a grandma spiked who sent to me I love the color it just reminds me of a Genji lipstick from glassy a but I can't name it right now cuz of the color and the color it is gorgeous but if you do apply too much it's kind of like a little purple he win it but when you play just the right amount it looks gorgeous it is so natural it's just a little bit deeper than the Cherry one which is again beautiful and yeah amazing formula awesome results and yeah I really recommend this one it is my new favorite
