butterandbeauty reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hey guys this is the glossier perfecting skin tint I'm going to put it on this is my favorite for everyday wear when I have like a little bit of redness here and that's really the only thing I want even though it doesn't provide that much coverage it's very thin I don't think you need to use an applicator just because it is so thin yeah I kind of draw it on all your cat and I just rub it in with my hands I do like how quick it is on this is Shane g12 which is the latest one but they hot live extended their shade range for so as you can see it goes on you can layer it for bit more like right here but that's it and I love it
