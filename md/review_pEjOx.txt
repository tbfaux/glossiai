curlyn reviews Colorslide by Glossier: I have my glossy a color slide I have it in the shade stable relationship I honestly think like I used to do that I honestly think this is a Great Liner it's like really honestly I would say it's like waterproof it's a really long lasting the only thing is it's called color slide and it like takes a long time to really like build up the color but it's like it's really unique Shades and I honestly think it's like really good as far as like longevity so I don't mind that you have to really like build up the color or that it's not as smooth a honestly think it's like really easy to put us like a wash of color over the I even if you want if you want to do that so I would say this is like a pretty good boy
