Fuknreynnaa reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: and how can we not talk about this last year Cloud paint in the shade similar color I absolutely absolutely love this product I applied at all with my finger I know I just applied a little bit and I did apply it like three times just cuz I did want a little bit more buildup but again I love the fact that were just a little bit it does give you a really bright color but still stays natural looking so I really enjoyed that again with wholly recommend specially for summer right now and of course look at how cute that is
