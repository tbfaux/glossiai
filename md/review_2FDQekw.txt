zameena reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so here's a glossy stretch concealer in the shade G6 this has been one of my favorite products ever because it's so light and buildable so don't feel like I have makeup cakes on to my face so I put this on after I've applied a hydrating cream as you can see it's a little it's a little I feel like tan for my skin tone right now but I do feel like it Blends really well once I put on my tinted moisturizer. Also used as in like other red spots which is why I felt compelled to use as today I've got some little problem spots today
