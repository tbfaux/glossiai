fourteencarrot reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: okay this is the glossier stretch concealer this is an old one that I'm finally tossing and I hit pan on it it's almost empty I haven't been using this concealer as much but I really like it so I have one of their updated shaved ranges I think I got the shade G 10 which is the lightest so which I like cuz this light was just a little bit dark for me especially as we're going into the winter months I'm going to need something lighter but yeah I definitely recommend this concealer I think it's great you think of formulas fantastic I've seen people like by the darker Shades and actually do a full Contour with this product cuz it's so creamy and blendable has really good coverage so highly recommend
