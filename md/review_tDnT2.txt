chelswend reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so this is the stretch concealer and shade G11 I'm very fair obviously you can tell so I just put it on over some zits and it says I have great coverage but it does enough I'm not going to repurchase this I don't think it goes on very Dewey and I feel like I have to set up with a powder I don't love cuz I really don't like Larry many products on my face but I mean like I said it does the job already have to recharge this throughout the day could not operate and is hypoallergenic which I appreciate cuz I need so yeah I'll probably go on and update put some more on my dark circles and I'll have to fix these this afternoon maybe sooner because it's angry so yeah I probably wouldn't repurchase but it's good enough for now and was an okay price 12 datos later if anything changes
