sonya reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: Gauthier protein as someone who uses eyeliner pens every single day I cannot recommend this one enough it's it's got a super fine pen tip obviously I've gone a little Beyond with this one it's super fine it's super easy to apply I tried to use what was left of it on my face today it's easy to remove at the end of the day but last all day and usually like if I use an eyeliner pen pretty frequently I get like some irritation and some redness up and in the corner of my eye but this doesn't do that to me so I will repurchase it
