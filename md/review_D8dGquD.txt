hannahbeauty reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so this is the product that I've been really really loving you using every single day and that is of course the glossier balm.com skin Salve and this one is actually just in their original unflavored untinted Edition I have loved glossy and I've loved their bomb. Comes for years I've had like the birthday cake won the mangle one and every time they come out with a new color I get very excited and kind of sucked in by the marketing but I finally just grab their normal Edition and I love this like I use this as a nightly lip mask and I really really enjoyed that it's untinted and unscented because it doesn't really add any color to my lips it just tastes a little bit like I don't know petroleum and lanolin which I know we're not some people's favorites but they tend to work really well for my lips and I really really like this stuff so in this case it kind of paid for me to be basic and boring and just get the normal good old-fashioned one cuz I really really been enjoying
