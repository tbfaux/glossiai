akitty19 reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm reviewing the glossier boy brow I use the shade Brown basically it is a little tiny brush that coats each kind of little strand of your eyebrows and gives them a little bit more definition a little bit more hole throughout the day so the same place and look more set like this is really great product have your makeup bag however do feel like you need to reapply it once every two maybe three hours for the wise awesome product
