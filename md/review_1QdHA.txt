thelittlegabi reviews Colorslide by Glossier: so I'm back and I wanted to talk about color Slide by glossy a I really like the formulation of these they're super smooth and creamy and they don't move they really stay put throughout the day they're super easy to apply I have Candy Land on the bottom lash line on my bottom lash line can't talk today but I know they're not anything revolutionary but I do love the formulation at the price point I think they're 15 bucks a pop so not colour-pop type prices but definitely not like Marc Jacobs price it's a really good in between a lot of fun colors to play with and
