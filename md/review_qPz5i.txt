khoang reviews Generation G by Glossier: glasses PNG lipstick I have the old packaging so I can porcelain crack this is the shade Crush it's like a really good raspberry shade right pinky is not super sheer it feels comfortable not too drying and has pretty good lasting power I would definitely recommend this super quick and easy to apply time. if you want to see what else is on my face and some of the products I used in this look head over to my page and I have some reason there thanks
