emilydoes_makeup reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: my current favorite mascara is actually glossy is lash slick at first when I tried it I wasn't super intuitive thought it was a little bit too lightweight and thin but upon like further inspection I guess I realize that it's the only mascara that doesn't make my eyes burn and it never flakes or smudges on my lower lash line which is amazing dads lovely separation of really nice length mascara and if you layer it a few times can get pretty good volume the only problem I have with it is that it doesn't hold a curl super well so what I'll do is after it's dried I'll put my lashes a couple times with an acrylic glass curling a curling iron and because the formula is quite dry you don't never fear that you're going to like with your eyelashes off when you call them again so but besides that I think it's perfect
