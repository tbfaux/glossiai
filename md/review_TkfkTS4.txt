FootprintsbyDianna reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I had to add these to my makeup collection it's a glossier's bomb.com I have it in cherry and Rose and mango and it smells exactly like what it is named after highly moisturizing and it's a very gentle formula I really like the way it feels on my lips and I even don't mind the way they taste which is a big deal especially when I'm looking for something to moisturize my lips and I'm constantly going to especially now that it is winter very inexpensive and the tube last forever I don't think I'll ever finish this product it is just so much and a little goes a long way which is a big big thing that I am I need and require from product
