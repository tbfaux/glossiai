skincare_obsessed_ reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: so I wanted to do a first impression of a brand new makeup product I just got in the mail which is the classier play vinyl lip and I got it in shade Casino, try it right now and I am super excited about this I love bosses so my first impressions of this is that I really like the color and I really like the applicator I really like this I think it comes on really and I said it takes like one pump and you get really good coverage all over think it's pretty buildable which I like a lot and we'll see how wearable what does but so far I'm really liking it good first impressions
