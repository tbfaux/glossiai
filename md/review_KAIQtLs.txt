tangomango reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so Cherry balm.com my mom has is so I've used it but I do have my own tube of it so it has a red tint it's not like super it doesn't show up a lot but it is definitely there so if you're looking for like a darker red or tan that that's really the best out of all of these or out of all about that calms it does smell pretty strongly of cherries in my opinion which amount of Phantom cuz I don't like the small cherries but obviously if you do you'll probably like it over all that one I'm definitely not a fan of just cuz I don't like cherries and I don't wear darker lip color but if that's like your you if you like to wear tie clip cut and you like the scent scent of cherries that was just letting it be a good one up for you okay next I'm going to start the review on the coconut I love the packaging on this oneit has no tint okay for the coconut one it has no tan as I said before and it's does smell very like coconuts kind of also
