legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: fifth grade so I'm in the middle of doing my makeup and I just tried the glossier boy brow on for the first time so this is Lindy darkest shade is just black so I'm like very very impressed by this I definitely get the hype so tried a lot of brow mascara is and all of them smudge on me they make their always just like leaves little clumps the brushes are always way too big so it always catches on my skin so I just always hated for a I don't know why I would always use them but I would always disliked it this one did none of that though it just coated all of my hair's so perfectly so I know it doesn't look the best but to be fair I also just don't have the best brow shape and that's why I always go over it with a brow pencil but out of all the brown mascara this one has 100% stood up to the hype for me like I was seriously impressed I was not expecting it to actually be able to just coat each hair and actually lift my hair is up words it's at 100%
