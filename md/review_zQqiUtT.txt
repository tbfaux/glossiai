helenemmert reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so this is the glossier Lash slick and I've heard so many reviews about this and I recently just tried this and I really like the wand it's really cool you can see all the Bristols and you can see it's not clumpy or anyting that's really good and I love how you don't get too much product in the wand but not too less and the formulas not really dry so I really like this mascara starting to become one of my favorites
