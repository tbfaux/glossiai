ashley2005 reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys so I have the glossier Lash slick and I don't think you should invest your money in this the price is a little bit elevated for what it actually does I'm not wearing it right now but I've worn it in the past and I feel like it's a like a a basic mascara and you're just buying into the packaging and buying into the brand of course I hope there's no controversy be to everyone's opinions are different but this is just my opinion and for the inflated price I think they're they're just getting you won't unhook the packaging it and for me I think like if you want a mascara that does the same thing as this by the essence lash princess false lash mascara this is amazing it's totally recommend this mascara
