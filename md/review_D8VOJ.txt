skinisspooky reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: so this is the glossy Play Glitter gel in the shade Phantasm it's just these iridescent glitter particles suspended in like a clear gel so you can see like from some angles to go there looks blue looks purple looks green orange pink like it's a really stunning letter I use this once on my list I used the glossy a silicone applicator to apply this it applied well one thing I will say is that it smells kind of bad like some weird chemicals and also it was really hard to take off which isn't good considering that this glitter is not biodegradable I'm all in all I wouldn't recommend this I know that glossy is trying to reformulate with biodegradable glitter so I would wait for that personally
