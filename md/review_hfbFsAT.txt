Sky wash in Echo by glossy a I just did this island and Valley so we're going to try it and it go I meant to do this one looks like it's darker brown but I think I'm going to kind of be light on the application and see where that takes me and I can't actually closes I all the way, freak out in just a bit on with the applicator and then with your finger working in it ends up drying mat okay so that was like it's not as Moody as I thought it was going to be I want more why not I really like I said I really love how this applies it's so easy I'll take it to seconds to do you know I'm too worried about using a brush cute
