She not supposed to smile but I just put on right underneath my eyes kind of and blend at lunch to knows I love a sunburnt Looking Glass this is really easy two layer I love you know quite a lot of it I just add some more calixto is very uneven look how pretty that color is anyone would like a slight Tanner Olive tone I was to be so pretty on you
