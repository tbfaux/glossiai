mads_beauty reviews Haloscope by Glossier: okay so one of the things I love about glasses Holo scope is that it's not only moisturizing but it does give you a nice glow we do we looking finish on that really brightens up your face I kind of put some on my hand to give you an example hopefully you can see that but I really love it because it like conditions your face while also making it like look bright and alive and refreshed not dead and another thing I find cool is that is formulated on from crystals so that outer core is what how's the crystals in the inner core is this what is what is oil-based which I find really cool and it's great for beginners or if you know a lot about makeup it's great to really you can wear it
