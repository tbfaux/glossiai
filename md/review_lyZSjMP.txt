zameena reviews Wowder by Glossier: hey also I am going through my makeup for a new year de-cluttering and so I'm going to share some of my favorite empties so this is the glossier wowder is here it is a setting powder that came out a few years ago I have a slightly older version of it it's got a cushion type of an americanism here so that you would just put your brush in and grab as much power as you wanted I really liked how this match my skin tone I'm only tossing it because it's old otherwise I really like to see the setting powder it doesn't leave your skin looking too too dry or cakey yeah I would recommend it again
