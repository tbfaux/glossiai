stephshea reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hello everybody I am going to review The Classy a perfecting skin tint today I have the shade dark as well as medium and I'm going to mix them both to create the perfect color for me I'm going to take about that much on the back of my hand it is very watery so it is very sheer coverage but that's kind of the look that I tend to go for anyway so as you can see I have a couple of blemishes and redness around my nose and I'm just going to apply it over with a beauty sponge so you can see that it's even out my skin tone with I did put a little concealer under my eyes little mascara and some blush but other than that it's all the skintint I like the my freckles still show and you do got a lot of product in one of these because you don't need full coverage
