aniyapromyse reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so I feel like I can really do the happy dance now because I finally got my package I ordered the glossier lip balm I definitely know what the hype is about now cuz he is so nice I got the mango flavor first of all I love the packaging something about the packaging because it's so different if I don't normally do this I love this to it tastes shouldn't say this but it feels so good to flavor is so nice but I have had this on my lip for about an hour now and it's still some so moist erised it just feels good I'm so happy I got it I actually got like a trio pack with the shiny lip gloss and I got on my tinted I just like a lipstick maybe but I'm all do a video on that but this is everything
