nevibaby reviews Niteshine by Glossier: so what are used as the first Tyler for this love today yeah I use like to I used a glossy a night shine in the shade pale Pearl so I just took it I put like a little. On my hand and then I use a small little brush that was like kind of fluffy but small and Compact and I just gently put it in there so I would have liked a liquid highlight base and I talked it with another highlighter and I'll talk about that one of the second the reason why I really love this highlight is because it's liquid and it is like intense shining as I don't know still use it on my cheeks anymore just cuz I like face mask size other highlighters for my cheeks but like if you want to like intense inner corner highlight for your eyes that is like just like a really pops or you just want like like how I use it I use it as like a a base matter highlighter the stuff is fantastic it comes in different shades for like different skin tones are to like different Vibes are going for so definitely worth to check out
