anamvi reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: hi everyone so I'm going to be using the Invisible Shield by glaciere this is the sunscreen which is SPF 35 and I really like it it comes in like a like a gel form so it's it's nothing like the texture of any other any other sunscreen I've ever used I really love this and I recommended a lot if you don't like the texture of of sunscreen under your makeup this feels like should have like a primer and it smells so good I love it and yeah it's a little expensive and it's really not that big of a bottle but I like it because it's really different from every other sunscreen of used and it works also reapplying it over makeup if you're not wearing a lot of it so yeah
