emms917 reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hey guys so this is the glossy lip gloss I'm sure you all know of it is a cult classic but this is one of my least favorite locals in the whole world I use it pretty much like everyday multiple times a day I keep it with me everywhere and it's just amazing like it's so pretty so we both might talk that I had my friend actually got this for me for my birthday and I just love it so much it's so pretty and I just love it it's not nauseous at all completely clear not too sticky and it's a great size good amount of product I don't know how much I don't think it's that expensive but if you're looking for like a really nice clear gloss have with you always put on at any time I definitely recommend this one so yeah I love fluffy
