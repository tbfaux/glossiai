riyahtaylor reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: glossy milky oil this is glossier's newest launch this is supposed to be a mixture of micellar water and weight loss oil supposed to be like the first step before milky jelly cleanser this is supposed to remove the toughest waterproof makeup and I'm not wearing a lot of makeup today but I figured I would just try it as two can I give you guys a first impressions and it's always I will do a follow-up first step is to shake itreusable cotton rounds but I'll look like literal milk squirt some on my pad here gently remove it doesn't have a smell that was quite easy and gentle I will follow up though with a fuller face next time
