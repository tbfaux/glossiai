valeriasernag reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: this is a glossier invisible shield daily sunscreen it has SPF 35 and as you can see this is a consistency it's kind of a transparent texture is Ireland use it that often cuz it's a chemical and I prefer mineral SPF but I would be touching your SBF throughout the day because this helps you not to ruin your makeup I just like tap it on and yes I love the smell I would totally recommend it if you don't mind chemical sunscreens this is one of my favorites
