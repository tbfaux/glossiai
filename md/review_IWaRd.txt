nicolemonaco reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: this is my favorite lip glosses buy glossier I'm going to put it on it's definitely sticky but it lost for a really long time it goes on really smooth very nice relocating and it adds for a perfect glossy look that I can get with other lip glosses after wearing this of Asura while definitely hydrates your lips that makes them nice and plump and then it dissolves into your lips a little bit so it's not as sticky after you wear it for a little bit I love this lip gloss I wear almost every day and it's $14 and you have to get it online at glossier
