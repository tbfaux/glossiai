swimminginthegrove reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: this is the glossier boy brow and clear I really like so small the applicator is I feel like it gives you a lot more control over how your brows like how the hairs go it goes on white but it dries clear and I really like this product it my brows don't really move at all during the day and it can last a couple days and still my brows look great I think my only concern is that because the cheapest so small it doesn't last a very long time and say I have to stock up a lot but I think it's a good price for what it is the product really works I like it alot it's really good
