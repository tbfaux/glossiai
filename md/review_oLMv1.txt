jilliangmeehan reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: hi I feel like it's been a really long time since I made a review for mac and I want to talk to you about the last year's Super bounce serum which I used to use and then stopped using and I use it everyday it's just really like it feels really soothing and refreshing on my skin in the morning cuz I wake up with extremely dry skin so every morning I put this on right before I put on my moisturizer and I just feel like especially in the winter when it's really cold like this so important for my skin honestly I do think it's pretty pricey for what you get but I also do really like this serum so I do recommend it
