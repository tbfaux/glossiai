kathryng reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys so this is either a updated or new review I cannot seem to remember if I have dated this product before I'm still in my dress from the party just ignore that but I'm going to be reviewing the glossier Lash slick mascara I love this mascara it's really lengthening obviously men's Christian old but it's got a really thin one which I love and it holds a lot of product I've had this for a long time packaging is really meant a minimalistic and cute it's a really good mascara if you want a lot of links it's really good at last a long time like this is it it's been on for about 2 hours including me taking two naps and going to a party so it's really long lasting an amazing this is my second favorite mascara right behind the telescopic and I love the telescopic this is a really good one that I definitely recommend to beginners looking for more natural long eyelashes
