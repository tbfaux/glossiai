emthegem reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hi everyone I am reviewing the glossier boy brow one of my favorites eyebrow products I've been using it for a while now and I just absolutely love it I don't know my color because it's a little worn out but I've been wanting to make this review for a while I believe I'm Brown and it's just super great for filling and I've naturally thin eyebrows so anything that just adds that little bit more intensity to them is super great for me I'm I do go in with the soap brow after it's just my preference so I will put that on and I'll be right back okay so I have the boy Brown this one in Autumn this one you can see that this one's way more full this one's a little bit thinner I'm I'm going to finish it off with just a little bit of gel and then we'll see the finished product I so here's the finished look you can see stuff Lemoore full more natural I may do finished with the brow flick so I'll do that after but overall I love it it's super great add volume and is very natural-looking and a 10 out of
