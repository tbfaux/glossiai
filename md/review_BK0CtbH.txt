livthebiv reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: okay so I'm going to be reviewing the Milky jelly cleanser from Lafayette actually fill this whole bottle with water so it's going to be mostly water but there is still some left I promise I'm not faking this but is not ideal, because I've used it for that's why I filled it up with water I ran out of it ideal for removing makeup I would say it's just good for people who wear no makeup or settle makeup because it's very good for dry skin and it's very gentlethere's something there give me a sec I'm going to wash my face and I'll tell you how it feels so I want to make it took off as you can see I did not take off all my makeup but it took off my blush and mascara which is still good but I'm going to take this eyeshadow with the Wildcat cleanser
