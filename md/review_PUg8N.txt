valeriasernag reviews The Playground by Glossier: so first of all I heard everyone complaining about the wrapping too much waste for these six tiny products like I prefer they bring their stickers back here's a Swatch I got the glitter Gala in Phantasm night shine vanilla clip in Pony and color slide in Adult Swim you also get the detailer which is a silicone brush and the blade which is a sharpener I'll be reviewing each of them individually on my future reviews
