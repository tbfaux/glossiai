Twoheadedcat reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: who would have ever thought you can find the perfect brow with something so small it fits in the palm of your hand as you can tell I've already done one bra you can tell this one looks way better than this one after years of being a weirdo having really out of control browse is finally cool but without boy brawl you still does kind of look super unkempt and knock you so I love it you can really tell the difference that feels that it shapes that and keeps it from being totally out of control but still looks really good and polish without being fully penciled in
