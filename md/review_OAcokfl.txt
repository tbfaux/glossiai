justinealexis reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is my look for The Cottage Court challenge I wanted to keep it pretty subtle with just a couple soft touches of color I did start out with an attempt at a floral Freckle look which did not work at all so I switched to this I started with a soft shampoo any pink eyeshadow in the center of the lid and then too deep in that up and add a little bit more shape I did use glossier lidstar in the shade herb I just applied it with the doe foot applicator and then Blended out with my finger in the other thing that I added to the eyes is glass a play color slide in the shade nectar I use the on the inner corner just to add a little bit more brightness and I just am loving yellow right now for the eyes otherwise I kept it pretty basic with a soft blush and glossy lip
