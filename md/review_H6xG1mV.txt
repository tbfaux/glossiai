wtvs reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to review the glossy a bomb.com in Barrie so this is what it looks like and it smells so so so good it's like a candy or something it looks like jelly it's such a deep purple and it looks really pretty on the left the tent so this is what it looks like a blight on to where I live it's not that dark at all it's it looks like a really natural pretty color on my insulin at least personally I really like you. I've heard some people get stock but it's really not so overall I would totally recommend of this it is it smells so good is probably my favorite phones on, even though I love Cherry it's just this one smells so good compared to Cherry honestly Cherry still good with this one's like candy
