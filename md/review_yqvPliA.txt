TessWambui reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: okay hey guys are so I want to do a review on the glossy skin tint this is literally my go to Foundation supplement I guess you could say cuz I don't really wear Foundation but when I'm going for more of them or do we makeup look this is what I wear I am in the shade G6 are the models actually but I love this because I'm a nice set of glow and it doesn't cover up my natural features and just enhances them and just overall it just makes my skin look very natural and just described it like it is very even I would say so I really really would recommend this product yeah
