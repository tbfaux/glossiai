kendrae reviews Lidstar by Glossier: everyone's so I have a ton of products to review the first one was the Wildcat and now I'm reviewing the glossier lidstar and Cub things are falling so I'm going this is a very nice pinky mauve and it went out really nice so I'm going to apply it on fast forward and come back so it just at the light Dimension to my eyes I really like it some people really don't like this product because it is sheer and it does sometimes come off I didn't Prime eyelids but when I did using this at the last all day that I needed it to so I've been really enjoying this I would probably pick up in different colors but I've been picking up make up for missing your photos and this will definitely be used for my senior photo look which I will probably take you guys alone for so yeah look out for those
