sarahokay reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: time to do my mascara and I'm sure you know about this product or you seen a video about this product but I need to talk about it as well I have tried and spend a lot of money on mascara for the last couple years I usually go between this and another brand and just see which works better for me because I'm always for some reason looking for something better but I tried the only one I've tried once cream brands I've tried drugstore Brands this is the bestI'm super sensitive eyes and I get flakes really really easily this doesn't do either but it isn't waterproof so you know if you're going to like rice Ash like you got it.
