Really quality of it seems pretty full this is the applicator I thought it was too tiny at first but honestly it's perfect for getting like your Cupid's bow and highlighting your brow bone in the corner of your eye is really well size for that this is a Swatch on the back of my hand just a really nice pearlescent Shimmer it's not too much but it's just enoughso I put it on my right cheek bone not my left cheek bone so you can kind of see the difference there's definitely more of a shimmer it definitely applies pretty well over Foundation envelope need to show you how perfect this is for just highlighting those tiny spots of your face
