Austria reviews Wowder by Glossier: hey guys so I got this cute powder from Lowe's here and it's cold weather powder like Wilder and is the shape G5 G7 and is so cute I'm going to show you the brush that comes with I know I said that it comes with the brush but it doesn't actually come with it but this is the rush that they stood Jesse to get with it I tend to get less oily when I have to make it on for a long time so this product works great for that to take out all that extra shine that you don't mind and it feels really warm lightweight I haven't been really into powder ever but I feel like this one works great and also I love the ingredients on glossy are in general mostly clean and this just feels good to this precious Supersoft so I hope you try it
