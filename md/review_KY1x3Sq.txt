aatalay reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so now I'm reviewing the rose balm.com from glassy-eyed this is what the product looks like so it has a light pink tint and it's Universal skin Salve so I'm just going to go and put them on my lips and underneath my eyes this is one of my Essential products is so simple but it makes a great base for anything you're playing on your lips or underneath your eyes are on a part of your skin that's dry or chapped so I highly recommend
