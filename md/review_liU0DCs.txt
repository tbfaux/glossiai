honeydewgloss reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hi so now I'm going to be talking about another class a product this is their lip gloss in the shade red and I'm actually really surprised that I like this because the last time I got it and my 2017 I didn't enjoy it so yeah that was a nice change soap on this glasses you can see it's like a little sticky but I'm honestly that's how I like with my lipgloss is so that's really nice and this is shade ride but you can see here that it's really share and I was also surprised by that because like the tube it looks super duper ride so that was a really nice surprise as well so yeah I just really like this class because it's a really pretty color and it's also really nice texture
