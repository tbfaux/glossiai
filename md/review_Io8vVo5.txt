Gabriella reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys so I know I've already reviewed bomb.com by glossy I but I just pulled this out of my bag and I was just reminded that I need to order another one because I'm almost done with this and how obsessed I am with this product so it is super moisturizing and if you're someone who loves vanilla and the smell of birthday cake then definitely buy this flavor I'm definitely think about purchasing I think they have like a tree are you can buy on glossy a for a better price than purchasing these individually I definitely want to try like the chair you on the coconut and the mango so I'm definitely going to go on the website and buy some new ones but just wanted to pop on here and let y'all know that this is a great product and I love it so much
