bellagroth reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: now this is the glossier cloud paint I have it in Beaman desk and I love this product the packaging is super cute I love it it's super nice and small to so I can fit in your purse now I really love this product I mainly bought it for the packaging just because I love the packaging so much good morning it does come out really fast if you squeeze it too hard so you only need a little time this product is super buildable to so if you want to bright pink cheek then you can do that or if you want more about natural Blends really well I also think it looks a really pretty on the lips and on the eyelids and it gives it a nice matte look but his overall great I love the packaging the color ranges super pretty even though I only have these two I would definitely buy more and it last forever so highly would recommend pretty colors I love the pack
