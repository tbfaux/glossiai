han reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is a literal Lifesaver it's the doctor Papa this is the tinted Rich mocha and it is so beautiful I think personally that it is kind of a dupe color-wise for the glossier cloud paint in dusk the one that can kind of your browser and I think that is dusk but it is just literally so beautiful it's on the cheeks and a little bit on my nose this is not good lighting right now I apologize but it is just so beautiful and hydrating it's like a cloud paint with benefits but this is just like a cheaper alternative and it's kind of skincare be so I love it
