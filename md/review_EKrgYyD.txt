fourteencarrot reviews Body Hero Dry-Touch Oil Mist by Glossier: this is my first impression of the glossier body hero dry-touch oil Mist I have used the other body hero products I love the scent it sindjelic it's time last I really love it and so I wanted to try this for summer because maybe I don't want to put lotion on after I get out of the shower so today when I got out of the shower I just Spritz this all over and rubbed it in and now it's not it's soft and moisturized but it's not coming off on my hands or my clothes so it's a really nice oil I really like it and I'm excited to try an oil Mist because I think it's easier to apply been squeezing out an oil onto your hands so overall my first impression is good on this product the packaging is really nice it's a glass bottle and a very nice sprayer so yeah
