riyahtaylor reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: call CA Mega greens Galaxy Pack detoxifying face mask I know everyone probably already knows about this but I just wanted to know a difference because I used this about maybe a year ago and I ordered a new pot and I noticed there's a slight difference to it as you guys might already know this is packed with antioxidants leafy greens and one of the key ingredients is white clay so it's a super cream as you can tell me that texture there but I've noticed in this pot comparison to the other one is that this one is like 10 times more creamy midget just applied a lot more smootherI have the mask on right now I swear I almost forgot how much I love this mask I'll make really purify to scan really nauseous it doesn't try it out I'm having a major breakout right now which is why I'm doing this mask but it's never like abrasive on the skin is just really nice
