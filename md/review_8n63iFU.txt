emms917 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey I so today I want to show you the glossy balm.com these are the two that I have the mango in the roads already showed me through Rose before but sorry this one I love it it smells they all smell amazing and it feels so nice on the lips has really nice to show you the color That's all folks think but it has sort of like a coralie color and looks and it says it has like a little bit of a tent but I personally don't really see it just kind of other good nice sign but I really really love this stuff teacher lives at moisturize hydrated I put it on I put this one on at night sort of like a limp back and then I put the song even more like in the morning and it just keeps your lips so hydrated I love it and I think you can get it for like a bundle if you can get like three of them but I totally recommend this product I love it
