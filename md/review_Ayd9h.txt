vivi744 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: the bomb.com is probably the best you know lip balm I've ever used it's thick and it lasts a long time and it actually moisturizes your lips unlike some products I know of and is also a pretty cheap if you get it with the glossier phase one set so I really recommend getting this I am in the I'm using the flavor original you can obviously use any flavor my favorite my favorite flavor is probably not to be birthday but anyway yes
