mila_bryan reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: okay so I'm a huge fan of the glossy skin products because for me personally I'm allergic to most skin products because I have a soy allergy and Mohs skin products have glycerin in them but the glossy a line has no glycerin in it and this skin tone is perfect for anyone who just wants like an everyday natural look at Superlight super easy and I'd give it a 10 out of 10
