Style_with_Audrey reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: I have pretty much emptied the glossier priming moisturizer this is just a very simple but effective moisturizer you know why you didn't just need that its simplest ingredient to give your skin the moisturizer that it needs nothing more nothing less this is definitely the product so it comes out as a I would say pretty light to medium texture blinds all very easily as you see it almost leaves a little bit of a shine but there's no Shimmer anything in it so it absorbs to her skin very very nicely I use this every single day in the morning at night and I think I told me maybe just a few months to go through so there's quite a lot of product in this tube and I would definitely consider repurchasing
