lucidskyn reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so today I'm going to be doing a review on the glossier Lash slick I just started using this product and honestly I can say that I'm in love with it this is what the lawn looks like it's super nice it really long as your lashes separates them makes them look super clump-free and really natural one thing I can say that I don't like about the product is a don't really like how it doesn't give my lashes a lot of volume it does give them a lot of length which I like but I like to see my lashes if that makes sense from a distance but usually with me I have really dark brown eyes so it's really hard to see my losses to begin with so that's only one negative aspect I have about this product but I can apply layers on layers and it does not Clump which I love about it so I definitely will be repurchasing this
