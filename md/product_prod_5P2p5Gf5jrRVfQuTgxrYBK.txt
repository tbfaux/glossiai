Hand Cream by Glossier: What it is: Supercharged moisture in a palm-sized pod with sleek curves and 360º squeeze.
Why it’s special:
Fast-absorbing, nutrient-rich moisturizers (like Meadowfoam Seed Oil and Coconut Fruit Extract) nourish without a greasy feel
Uses a “Second Skin” Matrix to hold moisture in and keep skin-stressors out
An ergonomic pack designed for on-the-go application, with a click-to-close cap to secure against spills in the bottom of your bag (or anywhere else)
A Glossier You scent reimagined for the hands—it wears closer, with an emphasis on the fresh, clean notes
