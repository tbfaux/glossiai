bodybeauty reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: a girl treated herself for her birthday glossy a and got herself the stretch concealer so I got the shade G5 and looking at it right now it looks a little dark but well I haven't even touched it cuz I'm super scared but let's go ahead and oh wow okay and then just add it on first of all it looks like it oxidizes second of all it's really nice I think it Blends in really want my skin as you can see it's super creamy and really really nicethat's the color and that's what it looks like when it's washed on the hand ever so scared that it was going to be a little bit too dark or a little bit too light and won't let you know as well but because of the like really creamy and easy to use formula it doesn't blend into your skin and sort of a dab
