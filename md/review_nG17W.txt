_emilymarie reviews Solution by Glossier: glossier solution I think this is honestly one of the products that kept my skin looking so great because it's a chemical exfoliator so it has all three of these chemical exfoliators which are great to sloth off like dead skin cells and yeah I love the applicator I choose kind of press Yukon pad on their product comes out really easy so yeah whenever I use this as my skin just looks brighter in the morning and I think this really has helped to keep my skin healthy and acne free bright smooth texture free all of that stuff I need to see doctor Miracle product and yeah it doesn't work for everyone but if it does work for your skin and doesn't irritate it I would definitely try this out because it's the best toner type thing I've ever used to sew
