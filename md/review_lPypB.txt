jasmine_egly reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so I've been using glossier lash slick absolutely love it I have it on right now it really helps me to stay natural it really lengthens and even crows them I live in the other ones that I've used before and I really recommended everyone and it's just a great product and it comes off really easily and it doesn't just stay on even after I wash my face so I recommend it
