JayciNicole reviews Generation G by Glossier: hey guys I wanted to review also something I just got in the mail to see the generation G from glassy a and this is in the color is zip so I tried out of all time super happy they ugly package in reformulated this cuz I do have generation G and the older version in the color like and this Catbug broke and stuff like that but anyways I don't have any primer on right now and go ahead and swipe it and see how it goesthat wasn't super impressed at first when I put this on it's growing on me a little bit though I will say the new formula to me feels a lot more powdery than the old one which Four Color I don't mind but for fear it's not my favorite thing but overall I still really like it I think I'd like it better in like a pink or shade actually but it's cute
