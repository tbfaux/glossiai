bodybeauty reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: this is pequod saveon.com I have tea flavors cherry and birthday at first I thought they were going to be really sticky more like Vaseline they are actually more than that as you can see the consistency is thick when envelopes it's a fairly thick a little bit sticky but the Cherry want to pursue the tree when it dries down to a matte finish the only two days I'm going to complain about his price which is $12 and that's a little bit pricey for me and the birthday cake one is just like this one it becomes a little oily after you first get it and it's thick and then it becomes really oily I don't know how to explain it it's just for that comes out if you can't tell like it's oily it's not as thick as it used to be one on the way
