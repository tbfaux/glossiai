CelesteDivinity reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so I used the pro tip from glossy to my my eyes and I'm now going to go in with lash slick for a mascara so it's hard to kind of see but if I were with you can really see like it gives a really natural look without being overly like dramatic I love it for daily we're definitely do you say don't wear falsies but also if you wear falsies it's a really great mascara I just find it's great cuz it's film for me so it gives you a little bit of definition without going overboard definitely try it if you haven't It's relatively affordable and I just really love it as a product overall hope you guys enjoy by
