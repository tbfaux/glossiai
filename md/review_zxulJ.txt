aperpich reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey guys okay Susie I'm going to do a review that I've been really excited about it's the glossier boy brow and then I have it in the shape blond my eyelashes they look dark right now but they're actually really light especially in the summer and so I'm really excited about this cuz I've never really found I don't like my eyebrows to be too dark but I like when they're Define and I haven't really found a good eyebrow product for that I've seen so many amazing reviews for this so I think you super grade for showing me what I needed and yeah okay so I just put a little bit on this eyebrow and then nothing on this one so you can really see it just gets like a natural color to it so I didn't really get a good video showing what I do when I put it on but basically I go backwards first and kind of an up motion and then select the right way and then I will take it up a little bit to give it a little shape and then one like line across the top to really to find it
