zameena reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: this is a glossier perfecting skin tint in the shade G7 a shake it first it lasts a really long time it is a light to sheer finish but I think that it does just enough to help me cover any imperfections that I might be feeling about my face and then you might think that it's not showing up you can see there it is but I think that's a testament to how good it is at blending into my skin I personally don't like a full coverage Foundation even medium Foundation is too much for me so this is really great if you want to achieve are really natural no makeup makeup makeup
