No that's like the cake and then like the base of it and I think it's very cute but it's shimmery and you don't just have to use it for your lips you can use it for like wherever there is no moisturizer or whenever I usually like kissing under my eyes cuz it gets a lot of Shimmer and I think it is super cute and it is the best mom ever belittle my favorite birthday balm.com and say I'm glad I say I have more things from glossier cloud paint the master and
