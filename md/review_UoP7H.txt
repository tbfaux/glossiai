bbygurlvane reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: I just picked up the reformulated glossy perfecting skin tint I used to be in the shade of dark and I got ga and its really nice it does have a way better packaging in Formula but I think I could have got a little darker if you're using as a shade reference this formula it seems like it stays a lot better kind of like bills better as well and it's like not as wet and transparent as a last formula so I definitely like it better it Compares a lot to like the Mac face and body foundation and I honestly like this one better for some reason that other one it kind of feels heavier or more uncomfortable and this one I really feel like you have nothing and it just sort of evens out your skin tone and then like in my case I'll just cover wherever I have more discoloration or acne scars or whatever with some concealer but keep the rest pretty minimal
