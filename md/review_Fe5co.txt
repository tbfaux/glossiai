Is212 reviews Solution by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy a solution it's a salicylic acid treatment acid acne treatment and one thing I really like is the packaging you open it up and there's this little pump on the top for a cotton rounds so you press down on it like this to release the product instead of like putting it on your hands and it gets messy or whatever so I really like that part about it and actual product some people say that it's stings sometimes it stings a little bit but I do think it improves the texture of your skin especially if you use it consistently so this is one of my favorite akwasi products definitely
