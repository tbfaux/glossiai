meesh_97 reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey I hope you're the famous glossier milky jelly cleanser I've been using this for a while now as you can see I'm almost halfway done with it I hate to say it but I don't think this really doesn't anything for my skin it is really soft and very gentle but it doesn't really help clean my skin the makeup doesn't really come off and yeah I think after this I'll just be done and move on to another product
