valeriasernag reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so this is a glossier cloud paint in storm and I absolutely love this product because of its versatility that's the amount I use Uber my sick like this and you can actually just like put it around or you can use a brush a little bit on my nose and on my eyelids yes you can use it on your eyelids to just blended with a brush it looks like the color is coming from your skin and not on top of your skin so it gives you a really natural look
