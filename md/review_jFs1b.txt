Banannabash reviews Generation G by Glossier: how so I got be glassy a generation G IN Zip I actually got this at the home store in New York when I was there a month ago I love this it's a really good like in between a full lipstick and just a stain and I found it really stays really well so this is it with just one swipe on I think it does a really good job of just getting a light layer of color so for like just naturally I'm not wearing any eyeshadow and mascara it works fantastically
