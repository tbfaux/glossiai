devinkielle reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so I check the mail before I cook dinner and supergate sent me a package and it had the undone Beauty lip2cheek pilot in the new shade Rosewood undone beauty is vegan and cruelty-free and I like this color actually when I learned that I was going to be spent this product I was a little worried because not all color products work on all skin tones are all not universally flattering universally flattering but this one actually is I just put a little on my face is super greasy but I just feel a little bit about the color payoff is I started with the light intensity that I kind of went down to the higher intensity but this really reminds me of like glossier Cloud paint and Mike a cream-based formula for like a fraction of the price I actually really like it I'm interested in trying wear shades
