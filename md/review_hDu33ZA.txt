beautybymonamarie reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: one of my favorite brushes for the summer is the glossier cloud paint and beam I'm wearing it right now but I'll show you how it layers because it's so beautiful I'm sure you guys are familiar with Cloud paintings by now but it's like a cream gel formula play it with your fingers I just tap it on but this is like a neutral peach color that she was out really beautifully on the skin and you can build it up nicely to be as vibrant as you want it or share it out to be subtle for an everyday look I think this goes perfectly with the looks that I'm wearing today keep the focus on the eyes but does give just a nice flash of color on the cheeks for me I love the Finish to its so radiant and natural and you only need to use the small amounts 01 table
