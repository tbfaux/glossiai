sisterzoe reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: tell me a little bit about the glossier cloud paint in the shade beam Beam is the most gorgeous peachy color and already had a bunch of dusk over here so I went ahead and started with a new base over there and I just put a little bit on my hand and now I'm just going to die but under my cheeks and just a blind that out and it's just so pretty so most natural little wash of color and I'll also say that this works really nice over Potter's and also over liquid foundation so overall I really love it I think it's really natural and gorgeous and I would definitely recommend it
