harmonym reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: I can't find a section for the big one but this is the most recent one and I'm pretty sure that it was his limited edition I know that but I'm pretty sure it's already discontinued and potentially not quite sure I kept this one because I liked I wanted to keep one of the two like Fruity ones and this one smells better than the very one that I once met a little bit too much like like a very vitamin or something and this one has a nice tint to it to it's more like a pink tint kind of and I just thought this sent was a little bit more subtle and I didn't mean to super sweet sense keeping this guy I'll probably use it less than all use this onebut still it's good to have comment down below what your favorite bomb.com is comment down below if you took advantage of the glossy a sale yeah
