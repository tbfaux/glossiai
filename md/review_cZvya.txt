skincarehoney reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: hello everyone this glossier moisturizing Moon mask has quickly become a staple in my winter routine with all of the cold weather where I live this mask has been a savior for my skin on it as soon as I can remove it my skin it looks plump and hydrated and it looks so baby soft this texture alone is gorgeous it feels kind of like a whipped consistency but also a cream at the same time it is cooling on the face so this would be fantastic in the summer as well but as someone who is Noah gets pretty dry in the winter. This is amazing not only is the texture fantastic but the packaging all together is so darn cute I love the sticker and I wish Clase would actually just give you stickers out as well I love this man
