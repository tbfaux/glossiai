bhumsss reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys so if you don't know already I am a blush if I use the correct viewing these and these are as you can see from the condition of this Blastoise are my absolute favorite Plushies that cream lashes by Maybelline & Decker dream bouncy blush this is in the shade hot tamale and this is in the shade plum vine yesterday during this on my teeth already put on my glossier cloud paint but I want something that's vibrant as you know that summer is around the corner so I'm going to go in with this I usually was this with my hands but sometimes I like to go in with my brush if I already have a base product and instantly you can see the glow and they're like highly pigmented and they give this nice Sheen to your cheeks very natural or you can build it up to be very very pigmented I love
