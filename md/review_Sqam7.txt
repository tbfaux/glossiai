hellojewlie reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: if you aren't using glossier boy brow on your brows who are you this is easily my favorite brow product of all time it's a one-and-done product and I'm going to show you guys how amazing it is I'm using brown today and I love the little spoolie on the end of this product just wipe a little extra off and it's pigmented so what it's doing is it kind of filling in your eyebrows will also shaping them with its gel at the same time so you can get that super fluffy brown look so quick I think my favorite part is one to drive down unlike a lot of brow dolls on the market not going to leave your brows crunchy or stiff it's just going to hold them in place naturally that feel like you have absolutely nothing on your eyebrows so that's it if you want a super easy simple no brainer brow glossier boy brow is the way to go
