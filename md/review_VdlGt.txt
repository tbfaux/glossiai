thelastdrop reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: Ashley where to begin with the Holy Ground of mascaras the glossier Lash slick mascara is the best a girl I had ever worn in my entire life so with these very small bristles it is so easily applicable and when you put it on it's so slick and it actually makes my eyelashes look individually long it just enhances on so much and it makes me look like I was crying or in the shower and they look black and blonde and beautiful and it doesn't come and it's easily removable and I can't remember this enough it is the best mascara I've ever used
