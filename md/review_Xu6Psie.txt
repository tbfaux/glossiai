yasminealexandra reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so this super great Cottage Court challenges like the first challenge that I've seen that's really spoken to me as most of my friends and boyfriend say that I live underneath the Rock anyways so I'm going to be doing a light kind of series Vibe look today on my earrings are from Shopkin mirror if you are interested in them on their small business so obviously sport that but today I'm going to be using glossier stretch concealer in the shade G11 with my not wet just completely dry juleps fun and I'm going to use this as a faux foundation on pretty much just too lightly cover my redness without overpowering my face or making it look like I really have foundation on there's the redness before hair and then the redness after so it looks really really natural I don't like this one under my eyes that way
