rebeccaramsdale reviews You, Solid Perfume by Glossier: absolutely love the glossier you solid perfume I carry around a notebook and a pencil to build a daycare lights off inside there and then I have a perfume on the go it's also not super overwhelming because you're a fine the solid right to your skin there for people that are a little bit more sensitive to perfumes it's not as strong for them
