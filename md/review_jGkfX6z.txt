JayciNicole reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: hey guys I wanted to review glossier Super bounce serum today so this is a hyaluronic acid and vitamin B serum which I use hyaluronic acid every night part of my routine normally I use this Marine hyaluronics from the ordinary and I would say I really like this but I don't know that it's not much better and it's a lot more expensive but I'll just show you the things I like about this one for now first of all I think the bottles really cute glass it always has the best packaging and it's little dropper it comes out pretty fit compared to like the high LaRon accosted one that I have from the ordinaryI do really like the thickness of a serum and I like the way it goes on and absorbs really quickly so if you're looking for a good Dependable serum I would try this out if you're willing to pay awkward the video.
