kelsbeaut reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: traveling back to the class A Boys on this Brown's the shade Brown literally just lost it and when my travel bags one time and now come back to it and I really like it so I'm glad I found it it gives the same amount of product is the same product I tried before but it's a darker color which I can't decide if I like darker or lighter but these little baby hairs in the front that are blond and covers those really natural and just give them a bit of a five of them
