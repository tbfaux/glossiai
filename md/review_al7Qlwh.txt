FootprintsbyDianna reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: this is a clausius brow flick and I got this in the color brown I like the very fine felt tip and so allows me to create additional sparse eyebrow hairs to make a very Fuller and thicker look honestly it is takes a lot of work so I don't use this everyday especially for work I use as when I want a nice clean fashionable look for a date or going out for some event or time that I have Ample Ample extra minutes to to do this but it is in my beauty box for every single day it really just depends on how much time I have great product leave the wax finish it is it doesn't streak it doesn't drip it just goes through your eyebrow hairs nicely fills them up and colors them does such a great job
