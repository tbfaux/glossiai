isabelm reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so today I'm going to be reviewing me glossier lash slick mascara and this is like a product that I've just recently bought because I was curious because I have been looking for a new mascara cuz the one I was using before was awful and clumpy and let me just tell you this is probably my favorite mascara that were used so the reason being while of it is because it has to be thin bristles on it which are fantastic and so it doesn't make it look like your eyelashes are clumpy or anything but it also kind of gives it a wispy look for your eyelashes which I love and so and also makes them look longer in my opinion which I loveoverall I highly recommend this product and if you are in the market for a new mascara this is definitely the one you should go with it's just perfect honestly I think and it actually I've heard it last a long time I've only had it for about 2 weeks now but I think it's fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anybody
