MarianaV reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys alone no one to review the glossier cloud paint is the colour-pop I'm just show you how well it goes on and how easy it is for the on-the-go look gorgeous you on this Metro bus. So so pretty like that I'm the pink what I love it this is a little small I 433 bigger but you didn't use Flex Seal products so I guess it goes a long way but I have actually love this you get this natural blush they look like it's coming from your skin is it look like you put something on top of your face so I love this and I definitely want to get it again
