lonnekemckinney reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello today I'm going to be reviewing the Bath & Body Works energy hand cream I have two other ones of these the aromatherapy line I also have sleep and stress relief this one has notes of orange and ginger just made with natural essential oils it smells very nice is very moisturizing is the perfect size to fit in at a purse a school bag anything I like the packaging remind me like a little acrylic paint tubes it's the same packaging is like the glossier cloud paint switch I love that packaging I think it's super cute this is definitely a night time cream $24 and Bath & Body Works gives out those like free item coupons every once in awhile then they are always late
