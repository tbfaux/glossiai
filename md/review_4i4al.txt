Bmak0324 reviews Cotton Rounds by Glossier: hi everyone so here I have glossier's cotton rounds these are flamed or they claim that these are made up 100% natural Deluxe cotton I have really like these they are kind of expensive or $4 for a pack and here I have an unarmed contact you do get a Lago like so you can get an even bigger pack for less than $4 but these are just really great quality they do not like pill up on your skin which is my biggest pet peeve here have just a regular cotton pad from Target and as you can see it's just so fuzzy and it has like these little bumps and I'm just not a huge fan of that and he's literally like little pieces of cotton all over in eight these break apart so easily it was so these are just very strong and I really love them and they're great especially with their solution or any other toner made it leaves nothing on your face which I think is great and I totally worth $4
