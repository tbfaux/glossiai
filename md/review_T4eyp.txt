NayelieandAudrey reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hey guys so I just got in the mail to new milky oil from Saucier I've been really excited to try this out and this will be my first time to spin it so don't mind the whole hair makeup situation I just got back from a color guard competition we had to have a high and tight till that ponytail so I have left over gel and a brush. My hair was a mistake so anyways I'll try. So it comes to this adorable little package it's not expecting so I'm going to test it
