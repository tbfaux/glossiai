christina248 reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: hi so right now I'll be reviewing the glossy Ionic Pro tip eyeliner so I have a couple of glasses a product in this one's probably my least favorite that I own packaging like always super cute always impresses me but the pigments are good and yeah but it just try it out I didn't even use it one time and it was already really dried cute you look I just drew a line and it's already kind of dryer on the couches and chairs my girlactik eyeliner I've had my girlactik eyeliner for like two months in this one time I used it one time and it's already this dried like I see you got to do something about that this is a two-month-old eyeliner and this is like a week old so this is like the actual product is okay I just think that they sent me an old one so for me it's a four at a time
