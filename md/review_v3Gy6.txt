krisballan reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy a vanilla clip-in Pony it is so nice it's easily one of my favorite products now I just got it about a week or two ago and I love it because of the cushnie applicator and you just push the bottom like this and apply I like it because it almost feels like a ChapStick formula like it's not sticky but it can get really shiny when you build build it up which is super nice but yeah love it
