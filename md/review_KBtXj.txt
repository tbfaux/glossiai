devinkielle reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I finished my skincare routine I look a little less doll but the final step in the Oral Care series is to use your favorite lip balm after you lip scrub right now I have them glasses bomb.com in Barrie I did a review on it last night they sent it to me and when I got home from New York it was here so I'm kind of like wearing it out right now but it's great but my all-time favorite bomb.com flavor is coconut I was always very shocked by this because it does not to me smell and taste like the ordinary coconut flavored beauty product that has like these underlying like warm vanilla scent I don't know it's just really really good and this one's my favorite so usually after a lip scrub I reach for coconut balm.com and put it on and then my lips and nice and soft and ready to kiss
