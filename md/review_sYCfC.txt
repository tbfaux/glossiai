lonnekemckinney reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hello so today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy eyelid star in the shade slip I would describe this as a baby pink with champagne Shimmer this is my favorite color of the lid stars but the formula is a little bit weird on this one it's a little bit harder to work with as sometimes it comes up a little bit patchy but it's not that hard to correct and fix I do really like this shade because I think it is the most natural out of the three I have weight now I'm missing oneput on it's the most natural my opinion I have called van Moon and slipped when is also pretty natural but it has a very blue Shimmer sorry for rambling so much about that but I do really recommend salad Stars
