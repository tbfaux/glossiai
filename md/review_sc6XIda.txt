zenyoubih reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: Celexa reviews on glossier cloud paint in the shade storm for blush on I'm not going to do too much which is really easy to do with a product like this so I'm really just going to squeeze the smallest bit on my finger and then tap it on the apples of my cheeks ever-so-slightly so even this might be a bit too much but I just put a little tab right there and then a little tab right there and then from there I just blend it out with the tips of my fingers as much as possible because too much blush to make you kind of look like a child at least to me what is why I don't use blush right often but when it is used properly it actually makes the skin look like really really nice and cute so that stop for blush like I said I don't want to put too much cuz I don't want to overdo it especially with this product that you build it up too much it'll definitely like show so honor to the next step
