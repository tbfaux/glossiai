Ellisedp reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys salmon review glossier's bomb.com in the birthday cake flavor here's a packaging as you could see it already really kind of worn and it's only cuz I was in my pocket for the few days I know I was really excited to use this bomb however after using a phone a couple times the consistency change like drastically as you can see it's no longer like a bomb my sweet it's just his oil leak oil stuff comes out and if you could see but it's just disgusting about this I wanted to love this phone is so popular I emailed the company asking what was going on in his head to refrigerate it and I massage the bottle and all sorts of stuff to fix it for almost a week I massage it constantly and it just it won't go back to the right consistency and it's hard to use now why what do I put for some random get the oil on my lips, disgusting so upset about it but hopefully yours is better
