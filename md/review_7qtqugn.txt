legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: fifth grade so I just finished using the sample of glossier's cloud paint in the shade puff and so last time I use the sample I use like a little bit of it I just tried to do it or settle up with it but this time I actually put on quite a lot to try to see just how pigmented it could get so this is the results of me kind of you know pressing it in here blending it out and then repeatedly pressing more layers in like centering right beneath my eyes to see what it would look like built up so before I kind of put on setting spray and everything else it looked a little bit clownish but after I did said in your settings for you know that I actually think this looks pretty natural it's still a very yeah it's still like us more subtle color but I definitely think that it's it was buildable you can definitely get the color to show up even though it is just such as like you know very normal paint color I think it's still very very pretty so yeah definitely very impressed with Cloud paint so far
