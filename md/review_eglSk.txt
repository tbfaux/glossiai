summer reviews Solution by Glossier: so there's probably a million and one reviews of coffee solution but I really really love it because I feel like I'm just like a pimply person in general I've always had acne I probably will always have pimples but since using solution my skin just looks healthier and when I'm touching my face with massaging my face I feel it made but it's so smooth I have a pimple on the side of my face but I feel like it'll go away quickly and that's what usually happens with solution like the pimples that I do have last for like 2 days and then they're gone they're smooth another thing about this that I recently started doing I don't apply it with a cotton round anymore I just squirted on my hands and like really massage it into my skin and it's like so different it's so much better that way so maybe try that
