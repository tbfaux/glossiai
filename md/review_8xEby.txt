Lai2ly reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: this is glossier's new mango bomb.com it is so nice the formula is a bit on the oil the year side I've only tried the rose and the Cherry one and yeah so I feel like if it's more creamy more smooth and more oily because your lips a gorgeous subtle pink fake very light 10th it just kind of like enhances them I've got it on right now it is super smooth and it smells so good and I ordered this other one cuz I'm running out of the Cherry one and this one didn't come like this so this is a brand-new tree whatever and then the mangle one just it was just like that which is super sad also the stickers are so freaking adorable and yeah I would totally recommend this one cuz it smells so good and it's like a much better formula it reminds me of Ernie and Big Bird from Sesame Street
