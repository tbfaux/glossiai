angelsoftie reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: okay guys so today I'm going to be reviewing the Smoky jelly cleanser by glossy really fast I love this cleanser because I always leaves my face soft smooth and hydrated and it actually like you can use on a wet face or like a dry face and videos on dry face to remove Zoo makeup and leaves your face soft but if you sit on wet skin it also leaves it soft and it just makes your skin feels so like a soft smooth and cleansed cute and cruelty-free
