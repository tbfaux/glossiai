Invisible Shield by Glossier: Not optional. If you don’t already use sun protection every day, now’s the time to start. If you do, good! Now it’s time for an upgrade. Introducing sunscreen for people who hate wearing sunscreen—a clear watergel formula filled with active microcapsules that instantly absorbs into skin with no greasy residue and zero white cast. It helps prevent sun damage and skin cancer, but also works to neutralize harmful free radicals, and keeps pollutant junk from getting in there in the first place—that’s the “+”. We want you to use it every single morning as the last step in your skincare routine.
