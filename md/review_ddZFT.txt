hellojewlie reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: I'm not a huge fan of drugstore makeup products I'm just a bit of a snob but I have to share this one with you guys so this is the elf cream blush and peach perfect and wow if you love a cream or liquid blush you absolutely have to pick this up I think it's like two or three dollars I got mine at Target this shade really reminds me of being from glossier cloud paint but to be honest this is just a lot easier to control and easier to get the exact amount of products that I bought so I just get some of my finger like sotap it and it's so subtle and it really where is all-day a lot of times cream and liquid blush is the first thing to disappear off of your face but this last and last and even at the end of the day like I still have a bit of a Flash and it just looks so natural and pretty highly recommend
