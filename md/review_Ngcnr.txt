GracieS reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: okay today I am talking about the boy brow so this is a glossy a product and you guys know I love glossy a for eyebrows so the thing I hate most or eyebrows look to sculpted or to fake but this is a really great job of making them look natural and feel natural it comes in brown blond and clear and I think it's an amazing product I use a ton of wearing it right now and my eyebrows still look natural and I was so scared to pencil in eyebrows and I used to just brush them but this really the finished look and makes you feel like you have something special everyday and also makes your eyes pop so it 10 out of 10 recommended super trendy product to glossier boy brow
