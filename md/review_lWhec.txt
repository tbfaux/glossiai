Bmak0324 reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: I am reviewing glossier's lipstick this is their newest release I ordered it the day that it came out I was really excited for this I'm not begging to spot treatments because I find that it just dries and makes my zit last longer if I was going to give this a shot here is the inside it's a Rollerball dreaming that comes out I keep this in my purse and when I feel a zit coming on and put it on immediately it dries on matte clear which I think is really great I'm not too sure about it yet I'm still like I said I just recently got it I haven't had that many zits but I'm willing to keep trying it and I will give you guys an update review
