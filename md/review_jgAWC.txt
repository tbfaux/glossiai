hannahbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi I wanted to talk a little bit of today about glossier Cloud paint I haven't in beam which is this beautiful like pinky Coral almost like peach color I actually had no plans on buying any Cloud paint and then I went to the glasses store in La and I had the opportunity to Swatch all of them and this color but it just grabbed me so I'm wearing it today and I do really really like this product I I mean besides the little paint tube packaging which is so adorable it really does blend in seamlessly into your skin and I usually just take a little bit like a tiny tiny amount on my middle finger and just kind of padded in and then blend it with like a clean finger and it really kind of brings your cheekbones up so it gives you this like really bright lifted look and I think it's I think it's a phenomenal product and it's easy to use
