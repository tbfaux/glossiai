glittercrocs reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: this is the thought he bomb.com in the birthday flavor first off a has this really pretty packaging as you can see it has this little holographic part and then it has the glossy G so this is basically and lip balm and this one in particular smells like birthday cake so I squeeze some of it out of the tube onto my hand I'm going to go ahead and like Blended out on my hand so you can see I don't know if you can tell but there's tiny Glitters in it and when you put it on it just gives you this really beautiful Sheen and what I really like about it is that it does moisturize your lips and it does keep them hydrated for a very long time
