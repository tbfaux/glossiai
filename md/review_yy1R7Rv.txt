sonyakornitsky reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: Hey sir this is a part 2 to the video I just made of the glossier balm.com I was saying before that my favorites were only three but I also forgot to mention that I really love the mango bomb and the birthday balm and I also really like the one for like when I'm sick or like if I have a cold I did some swatches on my hand so you guys like can see some of the tents like these are the most tinted the three that are the most hunted and then these are the two that are like a little bit tinted but not that much the reddish one is Perry this one's Barry and then this was the wild fig and then the one on the bottom is Rose in the one on the top is Mako so when you put them on though the 10 it really isn't that it's just really natural and thanks for watching
