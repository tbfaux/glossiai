madierb reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so here's the glossier balm.com and Sherry I like to use this like everyday a little just simple the bomb but also add coloring because it is the Cherry ones what does have some color as you can tell but it's really nice for everyday cuz it helps to keep your lips chapped but also adds a little flash of color for every day so here is, before and after as you can see as the perfect amount just add a little color to your lips while keeping them nice and moisturize and I know that some people say that because it's just mostly petroleum should I fast lean and it doesn't moisturize your lips are like keep them moisturize but I think it does and it has a perfect Littleton Spirit everyday
