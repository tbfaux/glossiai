skinisspooky reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: so I'm going to be giving a review on body hero moisturizing lotion from class C A I picked us up a while ago and I used it for about a month and I started to notice that my arm sorry this is too much information regarding like scaly and I was having like literally an allergic reaction to it feel like me personally I must have been allergic to it but I was really sad because I wanted to love this I know so many people love it this is the consistency of rub it in to show you guys so this is it it's completely rub Dan and it kind of a Sheen die for me literally having an allergic reaction to it I don't really like the smell is supposed to be like Neroli but to me it just smells like old lady sorry I gave this to my mom and she hasn't complained about it but I will definitely not be repurchasing this and if this works for you I'm so happy because the packaging is literally so cute and I wanted to love it
