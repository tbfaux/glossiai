meaganforbes reviews The Full Glossier Brow by Glossier: so I've got the brow Duo from glassy it's Ralph lick and boy brow and this combination is killer especially if you have some but she has eyebrows like I do my eyebrows do tend to be sitting in this area and then it kind of in the back also like this one has like a big patch of missing hair so this is a great application it's just like a little marker needed scope and it's so easy and then the boy brow just kind of holds everything in place which is amazing I have brown and both of those and I think it's a good color match I love it
