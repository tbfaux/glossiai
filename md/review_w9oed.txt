georgiajay reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay this is a review on the glossier rose balm.com which I think is the best mom.com ever since I started using bomb.com I swear by The Rose one if anyone ask me for recommendations I say Rose only because I think it smells amazing I think this one honestly stays like this biggest it that makes any sense like I find the bomb.com like depending on which one it is it gets like really thin and like oily and this one has not done that at all for me which I can't stand when it gets oily I love it this one stays like pretty solid and I love this one because I feel like it's really subtle like the scent is really nice and like obviously floral and Rosie but it's like really natural and I just really love the rose when I think it is the best one out of the bunch
