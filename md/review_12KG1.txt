Bmak0324 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys I'm reviewing glossier's birthday balm.com balm.com is the universal skin Salve I'm you can put it anywhere on your body dry patches cuticles and especially your lips this is one of five flavors I believe but I'm birthday cake is actually my favorite it smells just like birthday cake and it is a clear gloss with a light sparkle so here it is in the back of my hand and rubs a little I don't know there's a blob I don't know if you can tell but there's like a little Shimmer a little Sparkle and it's a super subtle it's not super dramatic that's why I like it I use this everyday and I also really like putting it in my purse when I go out I'm not a big lipstick person so when I went a little pop on my face I just bought this on my lips
