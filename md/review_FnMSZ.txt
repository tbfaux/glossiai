Beautaf reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey best friend so I just got back from LA and I got us some goodie so I got myself some goodies I got them to share with you so that's something the first what I'm reviewing right now is glossier balm.com skeptical about this before getting it it took me awhile to get it still still hesitant to like order it online because I'm like it expensive for lip balm it's the only lip balm that doesn't make my lips feel super tight or just rub off in a few seconds and whatever this lip balm provides unmatched hydration it's the only the pain that I have that makes my lips feel constantly hydrated and I only needed to apply it maybe once a day or twice
