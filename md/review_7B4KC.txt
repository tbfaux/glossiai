clairewalter reviews Glossier Soothing Face Mist by Glossier: good morning I wanted to go ahead and move you the glassy a soothing face mist when I got out of the shower because that's when I use it the most it comes in this adorable little spray bottle so when I get out of the shower and my face is still a little bit wet as you can see I don't wipe it off I spray about three to five spritzes of the rose water on my face it has glycerin which helps retain moisture aloe which suits and rosewater and I just let that sit and absorb into my skin and then in about 10 minutes or so I'll put on moisturizer and then I'll put on my makeup
