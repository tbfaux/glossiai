thekristynedit reviews Wowder by Glossier: this is the one and only glossier wowder I have mine in the shade light medium so I love this Potter so so much because it does mattify but it really does not dry your skin out at all I have extremely dry skin and it makes it just look very airbrushed and berries that very pretty I have used so much of this product and it is a power that I would totally repurchase it has a really cool like little netting in here that you can like I don't know evenly dispersed the powder it's so like silky smooth and so good my only one light problem with his daughter is that if you use underneath your eyes a kind of oxidizes on like what concealer so it'll make your under eyes look very dark so I don't recommend this for underneath your eyes but all over your face it is so pretty and it doesn't make you look like flat Matt and gives you it leaves your skin looking a little bit but nothing too crazy
