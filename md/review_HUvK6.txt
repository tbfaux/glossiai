Naomishorti reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy lash slick mascara and eat retails for about $18 I know you may be thinking $18 for a mascara but this I've had for a few weeks now and it worse and it's lasted for so long and it's so amazing and it helps a lot for me because with regular mascara my eyelashes are really thick and really long so I put it on it makes my eyelashes look really fake and really weird but with this it doesn't and it's just really nice and it looks really good and it doesn't look clumpy or really dark or anything it just a natural looking thing and I just love it and it's about $18 on the glass CA website and I would recommend it if you really want mascara and it's really good and it lasts for a long time so yeah I would recommend this
