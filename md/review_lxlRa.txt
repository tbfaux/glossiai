jaimiewalsh reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: this is the glossier invisible shield and it is glossy a sunscreen it's SPF 35 but when you open it and you put a new click the button it's really it's clear and it just goes on your skin and like you know how it doesn't like what like most recent screens they are there really white and you have to look cute like rubbing them in and then you just really white but this one like I already have it on and it just very clear and translucent and like for me when I live in a place that has a lot of heat so it really protect me from the Sun cuz I'm into every day so it's a very good everyday product to just protect you from like everyday sun and it's very good price like most cuase stuff is really really well priced so I really recommend this product
