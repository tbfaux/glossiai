fourteencarrot reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: they're going to review the glass 8 Invisible Shield it's my favorite daily sunscreen it's SPF 35 which is a really great amount I obviously have super fair skin so it's important I wear this not only now but for later to when you know 20 30 years I will hopefully look a lot younger I really like it's a great consistency it comes in a pump applicator which is great just get as much product as you want I have it on right now I just put it on over moisturizer today it also lays really well under makeup soI think this is a great sunscreen option it is chemical so that's if you're a physical sunscreen person this might not be for you but I really like it so I would highly recommend this
