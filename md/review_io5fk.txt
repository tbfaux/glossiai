JaleesaJaikaran reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: hey guys so I'm reviewing the glossy a bubble wrap today I'm I'm not wearing any makeup and it says that you put this on before or after cleansing on before makeup and it's a lie and eye cream and a lip cream so that's dried out Supply on the my eyes so far the texture feels really smooth and lightweight I literally just open it so this is a first impression and then when I tap on my lips it also heals pretty smooth I really like it I feel like it'll be a nice vase for makeup I might want to put it all over my face but I'm going to just put it on the map
