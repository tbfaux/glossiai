chai reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: so this is actually my favorite morning concert it's by glossy a and I feel like it's super gentle and it's perfect for when you wake up and you don't have a lot of products in your face and you just want to freshen up your face I do like you seeing a concert at Forum stopped at night just because I find that this doesn't remove my makeup completely when I would apply my toner with a cotton pad I would find makeup residue so I found out this isn't the best at night but in the morning this is my favorite thing it I would highly highly recommend to everyone it's super gentle
