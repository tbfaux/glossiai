sarah_novio reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey guys so I'm going to come back with another glossy review and I'm going to be reviewing the famous boy brow so when I first bought the products I bought it in black and I was really happy with it but this time around they give to me the brown one and I'm honestly so happy with this color because it looks really really natural is product honestly lives up to its hype and you can layer it over and over again and it really just holds your eyebrow hairs out
