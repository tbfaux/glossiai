jojocrenshaw reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hello so these are my glasses whatever lip balms so this was the first one I got is the coconut balm I totally like this since I left out with the heat too much and I like separated but every it got together that day I got back together I Liked the Roses I make my lips look really nice and this one has not separated then the middle one is really intense I would say I think it's more like oily than the rose one I don't know why the mint is strong I put on my eyelashes now and then I've got the cupcake one and I feel that this one the glitter sometimes chunks like it did come down to see you really got to like work and tulips but it tastes really good
