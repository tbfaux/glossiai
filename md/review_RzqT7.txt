j-napz reviews Colorslide by Glossier: okay so I just did most of my makeup the only thing that I don't have on is eyeliner so I wanted to try my color slide I already had some trouble with a point breaking so I really hope that's not the case because it's color is really beautiful and I love it so let's just see what happens just finished my eyelids and I really like this Vine I think that it's something different to pull out for like a party or something I'm not sure the way I put it on his way I would do it but I really like this is something fun for me to grab when I want to be fun but it doesn't happen that often so I'm happy but I can have fun sometimes
