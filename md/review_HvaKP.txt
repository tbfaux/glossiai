emmykay reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi I'm going to review Cloud paint even though I'm sure everyone already has it and everyone's already reviewed it I don't care okay so all the colors are really nice and these are the ones that I use the most right now I'm wearing Puffs and he's I also like storms and how they make storm and puff or storm and they're all just really nice and actually use the leftover on my lips afterwards and it really just stays like for a really long time so I'm wearing these two together right now also like I feel like I bought these probably a year-and-a-half ago and there's still a lot left soif you haven't bought this yet you definitely should and if you have bought it you should buy more
