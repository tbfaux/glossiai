celestee reviews Super Pure by Glossier: this is the glossier super pure serum so again the packaging from glass today is always super super cute and this is what the Sam looks like it's a clear kind of liquid Joey and most glossy products have this easy-to-use dropper really nice so does Sierra Mist to calm acne prone skin breakouts and redness and you just apply this before your moisturizer so your skin doesn't dry out and this is my second bottle I highly recommend this damn this product and another plus is that it's cruelty free
