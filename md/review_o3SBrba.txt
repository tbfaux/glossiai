mads__jean reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: and my second favorite is going to be the glossy skin salt I believe when I got the purple one I made a review but lights and my fever has changed my favorite now is going to be the birthday cake wine the smell in this I will have to resist eating him and it has like little Shimmer's which kind of makes it look like lip gloss a little bit so this is definitely my favorite
