alexarae reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: this is the new zit stick by blah CA and the main ingredient is benzoyl peroxide at 5% but has this little roller ball on the ends that dispenses the product you just take it and roll it over any since you have I have a few fun new ones and I just washed my face so it is all clean and I found so far the roller ball actually feels really nice and cooling on your skin and it hasn't dried out my skin at all sometimes with these acne products I get either of these weird dry patches were just completely dried it out and it just sort of makes it worse but I haven't found that with this and it has reduced a lot of redness and some of these apps I've had already and I love it so far
