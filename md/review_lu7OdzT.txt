christinacolvett reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: Super Summer I love using cream products so today I'm going to be using the cloud paint and dusk for my bronzer and then storm for my blush so what I do is I just get a little bit out and put it right along my cheekbones here and Blended that out and then for my blush I'm using storm and I just put a little bit that was a lot right along here I'm glad that out as you can see it makes my skin look very Sunkist and natural while still giving some color to your face
