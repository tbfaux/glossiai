beautybymonamarie reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: I'm just getting ready quick for the day so I figured I'd show you how I finish off my eyebrows I already filled them in with the glossy a brow slick and black so now I'm going in with the boy brow also in Black the letters are all faded off because I use it all the time but I kind of back comb my eyebrow hairs with this to get the pigment on there it's a dryer formula so it's not going to deposit too much product at once and then I come them in the direction I want them to lay I like to brush him up in the front of my eyebrow cuz I like that feathery look but this holds my eyebrows really well throughout the day the fibers in it build off my existing eyebrow hairs to make them look fuller and longer I really like it
