fourteencarrot reviews Skywash by Glossier: quick review of the glassy Sky wash in pool I have it here on my eyes I really am surprised by how much I like the shade I am normally not a cool shade person I go for oranges and Browns but I just tried this on and it went on beautifully so my strategy with the sky wash is put on as much product as you can if you want a pigmented look you have to put all the product on at once because it's not going to want to let you it does pull if you try to add a layer on it will get patchy so put all of the product you can load up the dough foot... I like to dab just right in the corner and then just blend out with your ring finger grapes I would highly recommend these days I think they're fun there's a good range of everyday and more fun colors
