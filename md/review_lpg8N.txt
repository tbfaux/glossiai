missylissy reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to talk about the glossier boy brow which has quickly become one of my favorites and a staple in my everyday makeup routine so I have it in the shade Brown which is fine but I do wish they had a taupe shade because I really do like the taupe color from anastasija which is what I use underneath the Pomade the applicator is very small so that helps with the not getting messy I really do like this product because not only doesn't hold my eyebrows in place but it adds tiny little fibers to make it look more full to so all I have right now is the Anastasia Pomade for like to put this over it so that's what it looks like this is the eyebrow I applied boy brow and this is without it's also good to wear just on its own and I would definitely work
