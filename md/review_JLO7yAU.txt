beautybym reviews Hand Cream by Glossier: the next empty that I have is this glossier hand cream I got this and during the Black Friday sale it ended up that there was a bundle with this in the perfume which I was going to buy it anyways and ended up being like the cost of just the perfume to get this as well so I did end up picking it up I will say it wasn't my favorite I definitely don't think it's worth like the $18 or whatever it is it was nice having that I don't like about this is the packaging is super thick so it was really hard to get all of it out I'm pretty sure there's still some in there but I can't even like get this top off so it's kind of hard next is one of my absolute favorite primers what is the touch in Sol pretty filter glassy skin balm I got this in the boxy charm and I have absolutely loved it is so I get it was perfect in the winter time which is actually like when I used it up he's almost every time I do my makeup in the winter it was perfect a little bit when a very long way so it lasts me really long time and I would definitely consider person next to the mini sample of the benefit porefessional hydrate primer I do have a full size of this this was okay they're not my favorite but they're like 5
