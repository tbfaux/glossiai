Franthebee reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to review the glossier Lash slick I've had this actually for a while and I'm going to let you know what I think so firstly I love the brush on this mascara cuz it really lengthen your it really just grabbed every in white coats at product so that's the best thing about this mascara it's not my favorite mascara that I've ever tried but it definitely one of the best that I've used that part is definitely the brush and I also like that you can wash it off with warm water so you really technically don't need eye makeup remover also I forgot to mention that it does not make your lashes hard and crunchy if they still remain like soft with it on which is something that I really like about it so I really like this mascara
