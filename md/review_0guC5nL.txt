jada_renee reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so I just want to say how sorry I am that I'm just now making this review because it should be made a long time ago with that being said today I'm reviewing the glossier Lash slick finally so I'm just mascara 4 out of 5 Stars solely because I'm integrate Massacre it's not clumpy none of that you can do two to three coats no qualms whatsoever it's great but it's advertised interviewed by many as a lengthening mascara and honestly when I think lengthening mascara like I've had roller lash and some really good ones that really do the job in for me this one didn't do the job as well as people hyped it up to but that's the only reason why so I'm going to put it on really quick and I'll show you guys finished productso here it is it's on I know the lighting isn't great but you can kind of see it basically I put two coats on it's going to look better in real life I promise you right now if it looks great but I can't imagine how faulty but yeah 405 stores for sure
