JayciNicole reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: hey guys I wanted to review today the new is glossy April flick like an eyebrow pen marker kind of thing I'll show you so so far I've done this eyebrow and not this one I recently liked tinted eyebrows so there's not a huge difference right now but right here usually is more sparse and right here so I don't know if you can tell the difference but it creates really nice like hair Strokesso here's the tip it's like a felt-tip kind of but it's like really flexible as a really thick one but you can create like really thin Strokes how much anything you want it's amazing I would 100% recommend this I'm obsessed with it I feel like it's pretty much the only brow product I need now and it makes it look so natural and you can make it as full or a sparse as you want and I just love it
