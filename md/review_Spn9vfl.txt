tangomango reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: last bit of rain at least we have the mango bomb.com I have a fully like emptied one of these by the way if you're looking for a lip almost definitely going to last you I think these are great because the mango one that I have emptied that's completely empty I got this last December and it died just finished it now or like a few days ago and I got for Christmas last year so these definitely last a long time because I know you are paying $12 for a lip balm you're going to want it to last long and be really nice quality what I think is definitely both of those things but anyways back to the review if you don't like the sun of mango definitely pass on this but if you do this was amazing it's a stronger mango scent but still not like overpowering it's more sweet than Fresh So if you're looking for a really fresh one I wouldn't really recommend this one and I'm running on time for the 10th
