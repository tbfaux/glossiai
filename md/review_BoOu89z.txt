peneloqe reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: this is glass he's Invisible Shield something I don't recommend from glassy 81 it has orange peel extract which is not good for the sun why is it sunscreen then also it's a chemical sunscreen and it's not good for the ocean in the reefs in the ocean since I live near Beach why would I wear this also I just prefer mineral sunscreen cuz it's better for your skin a plus is that it's totally invisible and no white cast are visible
