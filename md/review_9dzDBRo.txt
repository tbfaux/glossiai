tatummasterson reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hey guys it's Tatum so basically I'm going to be doing a review on that I do care Brightside up brightening vitamin C serum I really like this serum it hydrates my face and I always feel like more in just ready for the day if you know what I mean after my vitamin C serum I feel ready and more awake and it gives me energy I feel like which sounds kind of weird because I know it's just a serum but I do really recommend this to your it is a fair price it's on the pricey side it's $25 but you can get it from Ulta or Amazon and it's just a great product so if you're looking for serum and especially a vitamin C serum I'd recommend it
