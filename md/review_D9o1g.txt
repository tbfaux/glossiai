Bmak0324 reviews Mask Duo by Glossier: hello so I'm here reviewing glossier's Mega greens Galaxy Pack it's a detoxifying face masks face cuz I don't know why that's so hard for me to say right now but I absolutely love this first of all how cute is the packaging absolutely love I'm obsessed with this Mass you're supposed to leave it on for 20 minutes it smells like kale chips but I really really like it has like chunks in it which I don't mind it though like I really really like it looks like it always going to separate sand like there's not oil but I always just kind of mix it with my finger before I put it on I will say does my skin kind of red but this is a mask Duo there's another mask that you're supposed to put on after this which I am going to review next so go ahead and check that out but I really really like this sometimes I do this just by itself and it's just really refreshing my skin feels really refreshed and clean afterwards
