nevibaby reviews You, Solid Perfume by Glossier: those of you that know me and probably know that glossy Au fragrance is like my favorite and I had never tried the solid I probably one of my favorite things is the combat looks like that and I just think it's a really cute and I think it would be cool to be reusable so I can like recycle and use it with something else it definitely smells just like the perfume in the bottle and made it obviously the first ingredient like I say is you and need you and then it built off of that and it does smell different on everyone I swear to God and this is the perfume that I wear that the literally I get complimented everywhere I go so if you don't want to bring attention to yourself and don't want people telling you that you smell amazing all the time then I guess this isn't perfume for you I really loved it retails for $22. Even the cute little G etched in Navi recommended for sure
