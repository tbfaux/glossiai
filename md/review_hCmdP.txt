lonnekemckinney reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello so today I'm going to be reviewing Cloud paint and puff absolutely love this blush it doesn't have a fragrance which is very good if you have sensitive skin like I do things with fragrance break me out if lens extremely well you only need to use a little teeny tiny bit since very pigmented it is a very natural flush to the cheeks as you can see I'm wearing right now I'm definitely going to get another one of these in the shade beam which is a light peach I love it
