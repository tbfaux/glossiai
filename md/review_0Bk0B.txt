fourteencarrot reviews Niteshine by Glossier: are you ready for a hot take on this highlighter this is from the new glossy Play Collection is there night shine highlighter and this is they're calling it The highlighter concentrate this is the shade pale pearl one I love the packaging it's so cute and tiny and it's so tiny. But won't show you in a minute I really do love the packaging I mean how cute is that little doe foot and I think it is a lot of product for the twenty bucks you're dropping for this highlighter there is kind of like a glob there and then there's the highlighter Sheen doubt I am pretty underwhelmed by this highlighter in general I guess I just have confusion why they chose to include this with the really fun other products I just don't know how fun this is I'm I'm anxious to try a couple of those Shades as like an all over lid color but I see like four out of five three out of five I probably won't buy this again
