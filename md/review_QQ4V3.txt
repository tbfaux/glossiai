valeriasernag reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: today I'm going to try on these glossy a prime moisturizer for the first time I got in a sample and one of my glossy a orders it actually made my eyes water a little bit so I won't be getting the full size it actually feels kind of greasy I don't know if I used a lot of product but I think there are better primers out there with a better price dead so I think it's not worth the hype
