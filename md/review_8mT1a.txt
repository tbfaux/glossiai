riyahtaylor reviews The Detailer by Glossier: glossy a place detailer before you say that this is stupid unnecessary and a waste of $6 let me just tell you that I'm really loving this thing right now and it is more than I expected this is a haunted silicone applicator and I really put that to the test if you're wanting like a all over glitter LED with glossy plays what are jelly this really does evenly distribute the product and its put precise as well so it will only put the product where you want it I'm at all so did like this liner look here amazing and I even tried it in theater duct as well and yeah I just works a lot more than you expect at 2 and it's only $6 so I would say it's definitely worth the coin like I'm normally not good with these types of things that is literally took me like 5 Seconds
