lonnekemckinney reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello so that I'm going to be reviewing the glossier cloud paint in the shade beam they describe this as a light peach I am wearing this right now and I think it's very flattering I really like it on the cheeks and yeah I think it is a perfect color if you're going for that like glowing from within look I think it's more natural-looking then my cloud paint puff which used to be my favorite but I think this is not my favorite I really like itI forgot to put a little bit on my nose which I usually do when I use blush as car looks a little that looks like it's on there but I forgot but yeah I really like this and I love all the colored paints I tried them all my mom has four of them I have to now and I tried them all in the face and this is definitely my favorite one thank you for watching
