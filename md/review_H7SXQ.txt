thekristynedit reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this elf blush in the shade soft Rose is so gorgeous it's so natural it's very sheer but very easily buildable and I love it so much so expensive so good so I'm definitely someone who loves a good Cream Blush as you couldn't tell from my glossier cloud paint I have so many of them and find this formula to be very comparable to those this was like two or three dollars and it's so pretty I got this recommendation from a girl who's also on supergroup her name is hello Julie or hey Julie spell j e w l i e n. Yeah she actually review this and I was like oh my God I have to go get it so this is a question I'm wearing today it just makes you look so alive and so like glowy and it leaves a really pretty kind of sheen on your skin but it does dry down to a powder but it doesn't bring out any texture and for two or three dollars you can't go wrong it's so weird
