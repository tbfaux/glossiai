ninii reviews Haloscope by Glossier: you guys so today I want to talk about my favorite stick highlighter this is the glossy a Halo scope and it is this the most isn't the prettiest natural highlighter I have ever used I'm obsessed it just makes my skin look wet like an ass just putting a tiny bit on its really buildable to I prefer to put some on my finger first and then dab it on because one thing I do see is that when I do to apply it directly over a cream product because I have like I have their Cream Blush on underneath I do find if I rub it it does take some of the cream product I already have on off switch is like tapping on my finger look how beautiful that is I really recommend you guys sorry about that
