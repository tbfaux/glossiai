ayd87 reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hi everyone I want to talk about the Anastasia eyebrow pencil I don't wear a lot of makeup but this is the one thing that I always use and it's super easy. You just let's go and see it fills in really nicely and then he uses side to smooth it out for a much more natural luck and they have it and it makes a huge difference and pro tip is to always go a few Shades lighter than your actual color so my hair is black but I'm a dark brown and it just has a much more natural look
