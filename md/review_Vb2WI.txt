Elizaepp reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: LA CA Invisible Shield daily sunscreen broad spectrum SPF 35 it has one fluid ounce in each container but it lasts super long time this works really well and leaves a really good dewy finish under my blessings that it will say about it is that it does work when you're in water it is not that durable it will wipe away super quickly but if you're not in water if you see I would really recommend this and I think it's overall good
