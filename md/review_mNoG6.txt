isabellamjohn reviews Haloscope by Glossier: this is the glossy a Halo soap in the shade chords and it is such a beautiful highlighter it's one of my favorites I think it gives a super like natural glowy look and it's like Fallas glasses like shame of it being like really natural but also like it's really really pretty so I just like to apply this like dominoes and then as you can tell like that gives so much pigment and then I kind of rub it in a little bit I do once across here on the Cupid's bow and then on both of my cheekbone and then the product to do kind of have to rub and the as you can tell it's not fully Blended yet but look at that pigment it is so beautiful I just love this so much so here it is all Blended and for the most part I think that it's a super beautiful glow you can definitely Lair it up to get more but I don't know if I like a little bit less than an everyday look
