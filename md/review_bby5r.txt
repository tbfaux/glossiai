sipeara reviews Haloscope by Glossier: grassy Hill scope has been my favorite highlighter since I got it which is over a year ago and I have you can see it that's pulled all the way up. How much I have left I have another tube waiting this is really good for dry skin which I have because it stays it's tacky and casino. For just a little bit but then I've had it on for well over 12 hours now like well over that and it's not sticky anymore and clearly see it because of the lighting but it's there the color is there in the shine is there but it's not sticky anymore and so it lasts a long time in the two besides long time and I just read you really love it it's really good
