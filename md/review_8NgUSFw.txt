maliyahmichelle reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so I've been reviewing the Gaultier bomb.com chapstick this is obviously going to be my honest opinion on this product comes to get right into it so this is the bomb.com by bossy a I spent about $17 from shipping it to where I live in Ohio some great things I will say about this product is that is very nourishing to your lips and the packaging is amazing really slow me on this project is the packaging so that's probably the best part about it and is very cute and aesthetic furtrendiness now the cons about that there aren't that many crayons honestly like on is that very pricey for how much you get $17 for this tiny thing I think is a little bit excessive but it's a good product if you want something cute in nursing I recommend
