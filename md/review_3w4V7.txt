butterandbeauty reviews The Super Pack by Glossier: these are the girl today's super serum set the first one is Bounce pure and glow and I think it is a solenoid starter said it's not the cheapest but it does they each have a good purpose and I'll go through that bounces higher lonic acid + B5 and it's very hydrating I like this one a lot super pure is niacinamide and zinc and Swae clearing this one you can see is my favorite and then Super glow I use the least it is a vitamin C serum with magnesium is very watery and I don't love it so overall it's a decent set I think you're better off buying them individually unless you really want to try a set of serums from first time so that's my take on them
