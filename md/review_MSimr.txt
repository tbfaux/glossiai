fourteencarrot reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: okay reviewing the glossy milky oil which is there waterproof makeup remover I've had this a few weeks I don't use it very much I usually use the Garnier micellar water to remove my eye makeup and face makeup before I cleanse but I just wanted them all this a little bit for you so can I shake it up saturate a cotton pad just a little bit and I'm going to take it to this place a color slide liner and diste really well so it hardly took any pressure and that is gone overall I like this makeup remover I think it is expensive for the amount you get this is only 3 oz and I don't think we're out performs a lot of micellar water so take that into consideration but it's cute
