miarenee reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi everyone today I'm doing a review on the glossy a cloud paint this is by far my favorite blush ever I have two shades of them with your storm and beam these are a bit on the expensive side but there's such great quality and they're super nice as you can see I use this one a lot and this one that is much a little bit go such a long way so I'd recommend only using this product line super easily and leaves a bit of pigment and such The Nightshade you get this
