mariahrnorth reviews Generation G by Glossier: all right y'all I got a Genji for Christmas I've been using cake for like a year now and I got the zip for Christmas I had higher expectations for the shade and it's just I think cake is just going to be my favorite and that's that but I will try this on for you so the zip is a much brighter red shade as you can see definitely very pretty very pretty but I tend to go more for like PT needs than I do right Reds I don't quite know what I was expecting when I ask for for Christmas but it's fun it's a pop of color it's a good time I don't regret getting it Genji as you know you have to put on a couple times to really get a deep color or you can do a lighter kind of just topical type of thing which I do go for sometimes but
