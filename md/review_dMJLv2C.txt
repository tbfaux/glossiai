elizabethhhloves reviews Skywash by Glossier: so I have a 2 of these glassy Sky washes here I have Valley and Tara so this is Valley and Tara and today I'm going to use Valley because I find it's a very very nice like natural brown color that is perfect for everyday I like to use a. Of it because a little goes a long way with this product and I like a very very softly diffused look so yeah I just love using that my finger to like blend it out it just has such a pretty like diffused soft today she's literally like a washer color like the name suggestsand it just it's super long lasting it has a powder finish so when you're done blending it maybe give it 10 15 seconds and it will feel like powder when you touch it yeah I love it
