Austria reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so today I use this product from glossier to put it on my eyebrows and it's called boy brow and it gives you your leg. Fuller look any cons your eyebrows so I really like it let me show you what it looks like so is this tiny brush I mean one kind of situation and just press it through the hair and move it out in the direction of my eyebrows and then he just like feels them in but he has color so I usually have like just like the clear gel but this one is really good because if you have like any like can I like missing little hairs and he just feels everything in can see the difference between eyebrow it looks fuller and is the product I told her you would recommend
