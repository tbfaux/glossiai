michireviews reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: today I'm reviewing the gloss say bomb.com in Terry this is what it looks like when you take it out of the box and the packaging is so adorable I love the theme in the aesthetic of it the Chapstick comes in as nice little tube and it's also a scented and tinted for you to look nice with a bold lip this is what it looks like on my skin and it also smells like a cherry slushie and it reminds me so much of Summer and maybe on the pricey side but it's so weird that I really recommend it
