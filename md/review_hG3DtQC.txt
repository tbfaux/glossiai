nadialynn reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey also this is the glossier balm.com in the original specs I guess this is the universal skins so you can't really see it cuz the light but basically it's like a ChapStick but also just like an all-around moisturizer I like to use it as chapstick it's really nice but I also like to when I have like the excess on my finger I like to put it around my cuticles and it really helps hydrate them hundred my skin I have super dry skin so this helps a ton I really like this one it is a little bit of a little bit expensive for a sore lip balm type product but it has lasted me a really long time and I've used it a lot and I you could never go wrong with Safari like this brother
