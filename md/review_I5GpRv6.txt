tangomango reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so this is my review of India glossy a mango bomb., this one or the middle one is definitely my favorite out of all of them but this one is like a nice orange and blue type of packaging this last I know a lot of people say this doesn't last very long which is kind of confusing cuz I've literally had this for almost 8 months now and I've used that much and I saw this much though so I don't know maybe that's just me I use a lot about how she's on my nose and like any other job spots that I have in this house last me literally so long so I don't know why people always say that it doesn't last long because it literally last so long for me I don't know if that's just me or something I literally love this stuff it is an overpriced Vaseline but the tubes in the light in the smell are just too cute I don't know honestly you don't need to spend that much money on it again as I said I've literally had this for over seven months and it's still have this much left so honestly like I did and I really like it
