KathleenMarrin reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: so tonight as a the final part in My Kind of Night lyrics 18 I will be showing you the classy priming moisturizer Rich actually a very recently just got this I finally decided to splurge on the marks pensive when I've been kind of holding off for a while cuz I really liked the normal regular priming moisturizer but I have to say after using with this and I definitely just got too much but after using this I will never go back to their other stuff this is so nice you don't feel it under your makeup when you put makeup on top of it it's soothing it has an awesome smell I can't recommend it and off my skin doesn't reflect it right now but I promise you it really leaves your skin looking and feeling great in it last
