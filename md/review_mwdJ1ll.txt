zameena reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: I've got a very stubborn eyeshadow stain on my eyes I've tried to makeup removers that I've posted before but it's time to bring in the big guns the glossy milky oil makeup remover so this probably should have been my first go to as you can see the stain is still slightly there I've never experienced this in my life this is a reusable cotton pad so that's why it looks like this but it did lift the stain quite a bit
