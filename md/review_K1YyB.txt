skinisspooky reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: I'm back and say I'm going to be reviewing the glossy moisturizing Moon mask so glossy says that this is supposed to be soothing and moisturizing and I really find that it does both so what I'll do is I'll buy a thick layer to damp skin and it'll be damp with my rose water witch hazel and then you put a stick later on it will be white and then at the end of the 20 minutes when you go to wash it off it'll be like clear so to me that means it really sinks into your skin and really gives you a lot of hydration so this is what it looks like in this is the texture and I like to apply this just because it really helps me not waste product so this is what it looks like when you see and then over here I've actually let it sink into my hand and you can just be like how do it leaves you but it doesn't make you feel greasy
