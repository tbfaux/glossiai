Maggiebethgibson reviews Lidstar by Glossier: okay I want to talk about my eyes cuz it's almost a full glossy a look here's a little bit of a better look it's a very light and very glossy glossy a different color are so the base shade I use this one in on Cub it's kind of like a pinkish brown colored little bit darker than I usually use for their colors I live and die by this one I used and then one other thing is how much are there pink hair colors I use those like everyday honestly but I use this for a very light color on the list and then this for a highlighter I honestly love this highlighter on like in the corners and in the upper eyes it's so late very shining as I mentioned they use it like every day for 4 and every day look just when I'm looking for a little bit of shine on my eyes and then for my brows I use boy brow best product out there and then Sephora's size up
