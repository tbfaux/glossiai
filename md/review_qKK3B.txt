hannahbeauty reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hi I'm Hannah and I want to talk briefly about the glossier lip gloss so I am a glossy a fanatic I love this brand I love their marketing their packaging and their quality but this has to be my favorite product out of all of them it is $14 for about a quarter of an ounce which is kind of pricey especially for a clear lip gloss but this just gives if you can see it just give this glossy Dimension and shine that like other glasses just don't give me it has the subtle sweet scent and the packaging is just it's beautiful like just putting it on makes my day better and it's infused with vitamin E too so I wear it a lot of times as an alternative to lip balm or chapstick this is my second trip of this stuff I think this is the best of glassy a and I would highly highly recommend this product
