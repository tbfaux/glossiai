lilahbrager reviews Super Glow by Glossier: hey guys and say I'm going to be reviewing this glossier super glow since this is a serum you should wash your face then to like a couple squirts of this all over your face makes it in and analyst Riser so first of all I think the packaging is really cute and really clean looking then when you open it you have the little thing and you just put this top thing it's like a queen brand so it smells kind of like some drunk elephant products and I really like the scent honestly but it's not for everyone also you need to make sure you put moisturizer over this because I'm not and I don't really like the feeling of my face it definitely last a while this is a pretty big container and it's not about her Friday so I definitely recommend go by
