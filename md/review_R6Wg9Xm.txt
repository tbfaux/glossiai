danya_ reviews Generation G by Glossier: hi guys it's so this is the glossier generation G lipstick in the shade Leo is this really pretty muted Brown it is more on the math side so I just reviewed the beauty lipsticks and actually like those more than I like this I think that this is a really pretty lipstick but it is more Matt it can catch on to dry areas of your lips augmentation is really nice but again I think for my lips the formula of the undone Judy one is a lot better and way more affordable I really like they don't get me wrong but the end of Judy lipstick is most definitely a really good dupe if you're looking for something cheaper than this but I'm most definitely still curious to try out some other Shades in the range so I do recommend but there are Jeeps for this
