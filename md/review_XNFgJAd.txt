audry reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: I know it's by Foundation I like he's attended waste Riser only sometimes just because I have the glassy skin tint honestly I don't like it I don't like it that much it's not pigmented it doesn't it doesn't really do anything but you know I have to hold to it was $26 I'm using the whole thing so honestly don't let that much but some of your cheekbones open my forehead you know full coverage of your face and as you can see nothing happens like I can't and this is with primer nothing I probably should stop you
