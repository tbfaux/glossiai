pergoddess reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: this is this I was bee sting to get this so this was also a part of my birthday haul I guess you can say and it is the highly-coveted bubble wrap I am lip Plumping cream by none other than that you guessed it or see it so so far I'm loving it I do not plan to use it on my lips but when there is product left over from applying it to mine or orbital bone I will bring it down to my lip sore on my smile lines so yeah stay tuned for a demo so far only used it once still seeing how I feel about it but it was good smells good and I'm looking it so yeah
