fourteencarrot reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: okay if you've been having problems with your face under your mask like me I would highly recommend the glass case that sick so one cool thing about wearing a mask is that you don't do our makeup on your chin so if you wake up with a blemish or feel like you're having a blemish come on just click the zit stick you know whatever spots that might be might be coming up I think it's especially effective when it's just cuz it is just starting so just put it where you need it put your mask on and let it work and you can also touch up during the day so Fight The Mask knee wear your mask but also treat your spots
