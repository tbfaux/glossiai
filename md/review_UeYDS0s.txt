glowingandgrowing reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys today I'll be testing glossier's lash slick mascara and I believe this retails for about $18 which is definitely more than your average drug store mascara but more affordable than a high-end mascara so this is the packaging it's pink and very slim free sample packaging when you open it up the wand very fine sewing your mascara doesn't Clump and it's really easy to elongate and lengthen your lashes so these are my lashes without product that mascara so I just like to go into the base and bring it up and these are my lashes with mascara and once again I have naturally straight short lashes lash slick isn't a very intense mascara it's very natural and just enhances what you have already
