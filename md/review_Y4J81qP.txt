zameena reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: after I use my glasses right concealer I go in with my glasses content I have the hug concealer all over my face so I just use my fingers to apply this tinted moisturizer across my face and my biggest qualm with this is that it doesn't have SPF in it already proliv I have other spfs that I can apply anyway look how creamy and Alive my skin begins to look soon after I put the sun on my face I mean stretch concealer is great for covering any redness or spots and this content is a great Finishing Touch
