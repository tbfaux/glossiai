hadleyyaya reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: how are you friends today I am going to be reviewing the glossier lip gloss in red this is one of my all-time favorite lip glosses it actually might be my all-time favorite lip gloss maybe besides the Fenty Beauty one I really love this product because it is really shiny and really beautiful and it is pretty sticky but that just means that it like last a really long time it's not like I'm annoying and anyway so yeah this is what the tube looks like it looks really a bright in the tube but it's actually really sure when it's in our lives I'm actually wearing just one coat right now and it looks really great on its own I really like the lake shuttle tint but it also is amazing over lipstick yeah this product amazing I couldn't recommend it more if you like lacrosse
