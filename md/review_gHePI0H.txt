kendrae reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: everyone so I'm topic of cream blush I'm going to be talking about the cloud paint which I forgot the name in the last review but this one is in haysi do have gone I think the brown one I still have the tower 28 so don't mind that on my cheek but this is it okay so like a like a line of it and then like it blend it out and I actually solely bought this to use on my eyelids I don't wear blush and is a very dark shade like yeah Blended out it probably looks fine but I like my skin so red it just Blends in anyways but I do use them on my eyelids with eyeshadow I think it's a fun way topop the eyeshadow game so that's what I use these for I think you also could probably use these on your lips to give it a little tent so this is one of my favorite multi use products and I like that I keep growing this collection so yeah
