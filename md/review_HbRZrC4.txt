legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: fifth grade so this is glossier cloud paint in the shade Dawn I have it on right now and as I said a mini videos now I absolutely adore this formula I adore their colorings this orange shade is just so unique it's such a true orange I really really love it but I did want to point out the one problem I have with his product and that is the way in which it is dispensed so as you can see it's in this really cute kind of like water paint the container thing which is kind of a problem when you want the tiniest tiniest a little bit of product as pets because that's really all you need this product is super super pigmented even if I only make a little dot on my hand I end up having way too much and wasting it would always make me feel really really bad boy thing in off my hand cuz I get so much out every single time especially cuz this is pretty pricey it's $18 for 10 mL and while you're not going to run out
