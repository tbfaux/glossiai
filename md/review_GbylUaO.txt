skincarewithcara reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: this is glossier milky jelly cleanser I'll show you guys how I use it and how it works out for my acne-prone skin has a really nice formula it is this Milky jelly texture and I'm I just need a little bit on here for each side of my face so I actually put two and it says to massage on either dry or damp skin so I like the first cleanse with this if I have makeup on or in the morning on just dry skin and then I will rinse it off it's super hydrating and leaves my skin looking really Dewey I just finished rinsing off my skin after about 30 seconds of massaging on the cleanser and I really like that as hydrating I highly recommend
