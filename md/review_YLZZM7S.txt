legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: his spirit so I've had the glossier cloud paint in the shade puff which is there it's super light pink shade on for the whole day now and while you can definitely see the signs of wear for my other makeup like I don't know if that makes mascara or lighter but something has definitely sludge but what is not smudged is this glossier Cloud paint now I've been out like shopping like I've had basically I've had a mask on for the entire day and this has not budged you don't see a line here where my mask was which I pretty much see you with any other non powder blush even with powder blush as I feel like I sometimes pageant and don't be like a patch hear that empty if I've been wearing a mask for a long. Of time this I genuinely cannot tell the difference I don't think it is any different to what it looked like when I put on this morning there's no lines whatsoever I'm so impressed with the staying power of this
