kelseysusino reviews Body Hero Dry-Touch Oil Mist by Glossier: so this is the body Hero by glossy a oil dry touch oil mist and I don't have little spray I just have this because they sent it to me by mistake when I was getting my lotion to sent me this accident but I'm kind of glad they did because I would totally buy this again it's smells really good smells just like the body wash and I think it looks like it's a nice fragrance to lately have on your body if you don't want to look when I'm a few more you can still probably put on perfume but this is just like so everywhere just smells nice and it's like an oil so it think it like penetration to her body pretty well, I had to load up everything like that in I don't know I'm just like I think it makes me smell really good so I really like it in the pickup body oils I think it also should be moisturizing which so far that's what I've been noticing I've only used it twice so but so far so good I really like it
