dewyinthedesert reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey guys it's damn I'm doing the questioning if we were out this is Lafayette is number one selling product it's super sickening I use the shade wand but it also comes in brown black and clear I find that I have a lot more hold than other route jobs that I've tried so application is super easy I find that I usually don't even have to use a second brow product it does build up in the Brows really well so we do need two coats players over top of itself really well and it does go really well over other brow products like a powder or a brow pencil if you do want to use it with another product I feel like it's really natural overall I would really recommend this brow gel it's one of the best ones I've ever tried see you next time
