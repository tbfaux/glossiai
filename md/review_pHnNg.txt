sarahjgomez reviews Niteshine by Glossier: so right now I'm going to be doing my highlight I put my blush and bronzer on I'll be down in the comments if you want to know what I'm wearing I already added a little bit of this on but I just up on the side a little bit more we just show you guys how I apply this is the glossy play and nighttime liquid highlighter and this is in the shape help Pearl I got this from super great and I'm honestly so thankful because I wouldn't have even tried out glossy play if they haven't given it to me so I'm so excited for all of this I think this is gorgeous I did pack it on a little bit much because I just want that extra bit of shine I put it on the side to that extra bit of sunshine in my look and I think this is gorgeous and everybody should go check these out I'm pretty sure they have three or four colors which is pretty nice and just like a glow it's not glitter butt
