swimminginthegrove reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is glossier lidstar in a fawn this is what it looks likes washed its $18 or four and a half milliliters of product comes in a little test tube and it has a doe foot applicator which is really nice for eyeshadow I think it's very easy to apply a lot of product if you want it looks really nice on the I8 does Chris a little but all cream eyeshadows do it is really easy to make it look very intense and you can build it up really well but it's also really easy to share out it looks very nice Blended out a little I am not a fan of the packaging it's in simply because there's no way that you're going to be able to get all of the product out of here unless you deep hot it would be much easier to get everything if it was in a pot but I do love this eyeshadow I wear it almost everyday
