stepstoglow reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: this is Klaus a bubble wrap so glossy bubble wrap is kind of an Innovative product because it targets your Skin's most sensitive areas your eye and your lips so I have been loving this and I do think this is a very underrated quality product while it is still new I think people are kind of discounting it as just a beginner eye cream so not to be gross but I am on day 17 of being sick and I'm very minimal skin care because I don't want to irritate my skin my eyes or anyting but with my eyes being a sin so they are right now this has been soothing it so much and my medicine dries out my mouth this keeps it more hydrated than my lip balms do because this act like a serum so this is a really great on the go keep it in your bed keep it in your nightstand product super Plumping soothing hydrating I definitely think this is a win
