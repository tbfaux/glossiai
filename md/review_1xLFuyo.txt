LynnRose reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: if you ever wanted to try something from glasses this boy brow is amazing it's their brow gel and I have it in the shade Brown I've had this for a really long time but the brush is pretty small so it really helps to grab and coat each eyebrow and make him super thick and add color I'm in the process of actually growing my eyebrows back cuz I want them a little thicker and this just helps to give them a very volumize book and helps to help helps make the hairs set the front stick up moreand honestly it's one of the best roast my eyebrows are getting so thick I love it they have come a very long way
