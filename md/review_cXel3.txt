sevillathalia reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: so this is the Milky jelly cleanser from Garcia this is one of my favorite cleansers it's very gentle it has a light roast mouth to me it's very relaxing I really like it in the morning and at the end of the day to take off my makeup to me it works better when I don't put water before using the cleanser I just directly put the cleanser on and yeah it works great and I love it
