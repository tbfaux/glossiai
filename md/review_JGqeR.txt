abooogie_ reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: I want to talk about the Milky jelly cleanser from Garcia family as a facial cleanser that it does have kind of a Milky consistency of a solution when you pump it out it's just lie and then you can go ahead and rub it onto Danskin as a cleanser and also as a makeup remover I do love using this as a makeup remover cuz I feel like it really takes the nitty-gritty of getting the makeup off I can usually do one wash and sometimes it'll do too but it does the job so you know when I go up after like with micellar or face wipe than I don't really have anything left over so it's really good it's not irritating it's set freeand I know I just feel like using it doesn't dry my face either so if you're looking to get a Milky cleanser I got this one
