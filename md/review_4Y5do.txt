lonnekemckinney reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: hello so today I play glitter jelly in shade far walk another one of my favorites so I would describe this as a copper glue the Glitters are very small with like slightly bigger holographic once you can see right there also the jelly that it's suspended in has a very prominent like Rosie tint to it it shows up a lot on my skin tone but it's pretty though I prefer the ones without any color like Phantasm just like put on top of another eyeshadow I feel like the tint kind of messes with that but I do really like it
