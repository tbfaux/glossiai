chai reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: desert the two colored pants that I own I really like orange Eternal so that's why Don and beam are my favorite this is Dawn and this is all I use for my whole face I literally just thought teeniest bit and I clean off the x's and then I just like start patting it and it's really really pigmented so you have to be careful with the amount you use Bemis actually my favorite because it's a little bit more sheer and it looks more natural but other than that these two are the best cream blushes that you can find
