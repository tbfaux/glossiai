thekristynedit reviews Generation G by Glossier: so this is the glossier generation G lipstick in the shade like brings so much color to your face but it's a not like too intense this is extremely built up though these are very very sheer I'll go ahead and swash this for you just so that you can see what it looks like with a very light layer can you consume in at any moment now so it looks like that when it's very very sheer and then if you build it looks like that and that's how it's on my list right now I do really like this I just hate the packaging but I do know that glossy is launching I'm not sure if it's going to be a new formula or new packaging of the Genji lipsticks on November 7th so watch out for that you can't buy this right now but this is just one of my favorite everyday Shades I think it's really pretty very natural
