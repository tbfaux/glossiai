Bmak0324 reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: can I have glossier's Invisible Shield is daily sunscreen that is SPF 35 I got this for Christmas I have been using the super goop face sunscreen and that's 40 I believe but I think they're about the same size and this one's a little cheaper I really love it so far it's smells so good I mean I think it definitely still smells like sunscreen sunscreen this is just kind of like a lighter version of sunscreen smell if that makes sense
