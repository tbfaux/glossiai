biancaxgarcia reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: going hand-in-hand with my last Card review which is for the brow product I love just natural makeup look kind of like now she's so effortlessly pretty but like putting the effort and obviously so you see a large extension to my eyelashes are pretty sparse now but I don't like looking super fake and I didn't like the opposite of eyelash extensions so I love how small and thin this brushes yet the way it's shaped Rosa gets every single washing to see all the little bristles on there and the formula top is also really good face washes there really sparse sure like I said cuz of the lash extension and thus it is largely gone I got a little mad with cuz I'm a human but like I told them I had you can see the lashes really lengthen and that's a lot better in person you can only just see like the effect of the mascara and I took is a perfect natural ugly clashes really long last
