CelesteDivinity reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey also less of a like tutorial aired ml but more of just a discussion I love the fluffy Cloud paints I have used the one I have is probably like almost 2 years old at this point long-lasting product but I usually just apply it. On my cheeks and then like a very tiny. On the bridge of my nose and blend out with my fingers or you can use a brush when you in a little bit more of a used to look but I love it I think that they're really effective very long-lasting and definitely worth the value if you haven't tried them definitely do in a few days are use them and love them let me know Below have a good day
