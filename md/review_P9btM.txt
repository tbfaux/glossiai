fourteencarrot reviews Generation G by Glossier: review the glassy a Genji and cake and it is this is my current favorite shade so cake is like a peachy nude gorgeous what I like about this product is that is light it doesn't drive me out feels kind of like a chopstick but it's not as moisturizing as like your typical lip balm I wouldn't say it with substitute lip balm in my routine I think it's has good staying power and you can just lay it all day without looking cakey or weird so love it
