mimosa reviews Generation G by Glossier: this is glossier Generation G in the shade cake it's a really warm tone peachy color I would even say it's kind of more neutral warm tone but I know it looks great on everyone that this is a universal favorite it's pulling a bit more orange on camera right now but it's definitely a true Peach this was especially great with coral blush if you get glossy as Cloud paint I would pair this with beam which is also another peachy color
