madierb reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: see here I have the glasses last leg this is the applicator this is definitely perfect for people who want more of a natural-looking ResCare rather than having like a lot on there this is before and this is after so I definitely think it mostly lengthens your lashes and it gives just a natural like lengthening it doesn't pick up like a whole lot of product so you don't get any comping whatsoever and because of like the ingredients but it hasn't it I definitely feel like it's very nourishing to my eyelashes like I feel like they have like I don't know if feel like they're healthier you knowalso feel this is a good mascara for beginners because you don't get the clamp and it's not really messy to use so I definitely recommend this to everyone especially for one more natural looking glass
