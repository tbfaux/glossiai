kelseylynne reviews Niteshine by Glossier: this is glossy plays night shine in the shade deep copper so I'm honestly surprised I haven't reviewed this sooner because I use it all the time this is what the applicator looks like and I just really like this product because it gives me a bronzeglo that I just like to add right here to my nose right here and on this side so I'm just going to show you how I applied it this is what the shade is going to look like and for fair skinned people I feel like you blend this really in with your browser it won't look as dark so basically I'll just do some. Swear I feel likeit should go and then I'll just when did I out with my finger start apply the product it's super easy to apply it's really blendable and I just think it looks really good
