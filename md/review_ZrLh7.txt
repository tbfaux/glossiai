chai reviews Haloscope by Glossier: I want to review the glossy a Halo scope and moonstone this is how it's watches it looks very natural very pretty I do use it over powder because I have oily skin and it doesn't cling to any places so that's really nice even when I apply powder I don't have her like a planet on my nose because I do feel like it rubs off easier than a powder highlight I do like using it on days where I don't feel like I'm wearing a lot of makeup more like an everyday product it's super easy to apply I use my finger and I just a bit on it takes literally like 5 Seconds I would recommend it to all of you I think it would be great for all skin types specially drier skin type and yeah I think it's great
