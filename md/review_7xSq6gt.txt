mads_beauty reviews After Baume by Glossier: okay guys so this is glossier's after bum recovery cream I use this on the daily as you can see it's pretty thick I only use like a finger is worth like the tip of my finger honestly and it goes a long way it's very Dewey what else it is great for sensitive skin or super dry skin or after you know if you're exposed to a harsh sun or cold weather often this is great personally I also have sensitive skin is so I do use this day and night and honestly if you're not the type of person who likes to use who likes to keep their skin routine simple and basic really this by itself after you wash your face works great honestly it works great I always do it like in the evenings I just wash my face and put this on and on
