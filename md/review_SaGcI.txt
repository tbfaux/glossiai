skincare_obsessed_ reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so I want to talk about glossier lash slick which has become probably my favorite everyday mascara so I used to wear the Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara all the time and I like that mascara but it's really dramatic so I've switched to the flash your lash slick I'm deathly mispronouncing it for everyday use and I love it I'm wearing my lashes right now where is really great throughout the day it is super lightweight it looks so natural and when I had it on my sister even asked if I had gotten lash extensions so my lashes looked that good so I'm definitely a 10 out of 10 would recommend
