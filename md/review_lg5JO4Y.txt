MyBeautyThesis reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: next I'm going to talk about the glossier Lash slick mascara and I really love this mascara because it gives such a defined natural links and look to your lashes without them ever looking heavy or clumpy and so this is my go-to for work-from-home days or no makeup days and I also love that it doesn't flake and it also washes off really easy with just warm water so let me show you how it looks on the Lash going to try and do this without poking my eyes outhey so there we go you can just see that is one coat of mascara and it gives just an elongated look to the Lash that's super subtle and natural but it's still defines your eyes
