theozhang reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: is this glossy mascara the Lash slick worth it kind of this lash slick will run you about $16 which I admit is not that expensive compared to some other more luxurious Brands but it is expensive for what you're getting so while this mascara claims to be very natural and defining and I do think it measures up to that I also think that it's kind of disappointing my eyelashes do look good there very naturally and designed however they don't really stay that way for a long time for exactly can I see that my eyelashes have curled that I have curled have fallen down but it's only been about half an hour because of this I like using it with a different mascara and I think that works much better otherwise I think it's a great product and you should try it if you are willing to lay another one or you just want to try a new one
