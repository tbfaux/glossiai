kendrae reviews The Makeup Set by Glossier: alright everyone so I kind of like crazy cuz I'm wearing mascara on the side and not on the side but I just got my glasses a packet and I have the other things but this is just about the mascara I've been using the Mary Kay I love I love lash waterproof mascara and the brushes from the Lash slick and this one are actually very comparable and I love what it did to the side so I'm going to go put this on the other eye so yeah
