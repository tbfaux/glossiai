jsteiner1896 reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys what's up its Justine and today I am going to review the glossier lidstar which essentially is like a gel cream eye shadow so I just put it on to apply at super easy just unscrew the cap there's this nice little applicator and I just put it all over my eyes and then I just used my fingers are kind of rub it in just like that and it really just leave such a subtle glow to your eyes I don't have mascara on yet you can kind of see the slight hint of Shimmer you don't exactly doesn't feel cakey on the eyes at all like I said literally takes 10 seconds to put on I'm a big fan I definitely try the other colors it is a little pricey but I think this tube is going to last forever I highly recommend let me know what you think have you tried this
