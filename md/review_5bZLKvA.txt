iambahar reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hi everybody this is my first serve you and I will be reviewing the glossy last flick so before I test this out I just want to say I really like this product it's really good at separating and lengthening lengthening your lashes but it does not volume iPhone stats what you're looking for in mascara this is not for you here is what one coat looks like and here's what it looks like compared to the naked eye I would really recommend this the only downside is it sometimes Flakes and falls under your eye but that's about it
