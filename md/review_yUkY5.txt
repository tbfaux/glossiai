ariannaa reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so my lips have been pretty bright out all day long but I just got this in the mail my boyfriend bought it for me I want to show you guys it's got like a little bit of sheer pink to it the flavor is right on exactly how it's supposed to smell it almost has a grapefruit flavor to it almost to me anyways as well so I really really love this so far and I will give you an update in like a few days about how much I like this stuff because it is expensive for a lip balm so we'll see
