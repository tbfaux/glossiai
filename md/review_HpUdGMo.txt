AnneBijo reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: this is my favorite priming moisturizer ever president for saying notice with this is anyway. It's very light billable and smooth and it's very hydrating to the skin I honestly love it because they're very light as well and see if you're looking for a private most highly recommend glossy one not because it's aesthetic but because it's like a really good quality not working very well so yeah good job coffee
