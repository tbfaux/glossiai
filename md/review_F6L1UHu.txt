emms917 reviews Haloscope by Glossier: so this is the glossy Halo scope highlighter in the shade quartz I absolutely love this highlighter It's Supernatural and it's less of like a glittery looking words kind of like a glow so it has this white thing in the middle which is called like a hydration core I'm pretty sure so I'm going to swap it for you so it looks like on my hands right now looks kind of like a rose gold maybe because I just didn't blend it in but it's a really pretty color all buns it in and show you what it looks like so you can blend in when using your finger or like a beauty blender I use like a mini Beauty blender and it looks super nice and on the scanner and super do we still got tonight and recommend
