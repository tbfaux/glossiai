virginiac reviews Super Glow by Glossier: so this is the glossier super glow serum and a serum that you put on your skin and it supposed to brighten and Energizer Skin So to use it you just use this little dropper which is super nice and the packaging is super cute I really like it although I do really love classy a this serum didn't really work for me I didn't really see like amazing glowing results but one thing I do like to do with serums that I found work for my skin is to use like a facial roller and like put the serum on my skin and then use the facial at work I think really helps
