nelliegreer reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: so this is the shade Angie 9in glossier's perfecting skin tint I'll do it before and after or compare side so you can get a good idea but I'll go and tell you I'm not a big fan of the products okay so this is a side that I have applied some of the G9 skin perfecting tent as you can see kind of just looks like my pores have been blurred going to class I'm on my nose so you can see I found that this is pretty much useless without concealer underneath of it just really is more of a primer almost so you can see it even skin tones very slightly definitely will not repurchase this just for the affected it creates it's nearly nonexistent but I'm glad I tried it
