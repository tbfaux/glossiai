Haler124 reviews Generation G by Glossier: hey guys so today I'll be reviewing something I got with my supercoin this is the glossier generation G lipstick in the shake cake so I'm obsessed with bossy a packaging I don't know it's just really cute so came with a sample of their milky jelly cleanser which I want to do a review on so remember to go check that out it also came with a super cute glossy sticker and now for the product so I think the new packaging is really good it's always been super cute but I just feel like it's a lot more sturdy heavy more secure I really like it these are my lips before these are my lips after I think the shade matches me really well and a lot of people say in their views that it's drying but it's really not as actual earnings little moisturizing but I do think that it has a bad scent but honestly it's fine because it's like a really good product and that's only thing wrong so I gave it a four to five
