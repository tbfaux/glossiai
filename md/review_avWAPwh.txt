RelatableRach reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: I'm letting go of this because I just feel like it's too light and my skin kind of has a little bit more variation in the winter as far as drying and it's just like isn't cutting it bounced is great I sometimes we'll split them and use this in my p.m. routine and the super glow in the morning but it's just not what I need for this time of year but especially with masks and warmer climates I definitely avoid imagine that using the clausius Super bounce and super glow is a good choice
