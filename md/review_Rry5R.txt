butterandbeauty reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: this is the glossier priming moisturizer Rich I've had this for quite a while as you can see by the leave will be in a little secrets of disintegrative actually just finished this but I did want to review it before I got rid of the sharp because I do think it's quite good at $35 for a pretty good for a good night cream I think this is reasonably priced you and I don't look like you got a ton but it's very thick ceiling really need to use a little bit of time my chief complaint is that there's a scent of lavender I don't think it's added fragrance I think it's just because you're some lavender oil I just don't like that since most people do so I'm in the minority there but it really is very good at nourishing and hydrating especially in the winter so if you're looking for like a portable Zoom mid priced one I think this is definitely worth a shot glass he also has a dentist in return policy if you can't check it out in stores so you can do that as well
