rebeccaramsdale reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: is the glass A priming moisturizer this is probably my fifth bottle of this product Asus product both day and night like a good amount and I find that it's lightweight but definitely buildable so I can apply more anywhere I feel I need extra moisture and it wears really nicely underneath makeup as well which is always a bonus at least my skin feeling doing and hydrated and I find it's perfect kind of in the warmer months all usually use it from Springtime all the way through until fall and then I'll switch to something a little bit more heavy duty
