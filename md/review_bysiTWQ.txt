nikitaseth reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: tried-and-true temp talk about glossier boy brow I use it in brown bread houston-clear I've also tried out black my hair is super dark but black is a little too dark for this brush is stunning it's pretty tiny if it's a lot of products or recommend scraping a lot of this off or only using part of it as a way to get really really bored and firm luck
