amudaus reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: okay so I didn't realize that the other review had cut off like my whole explanation on why I like it like some bad things about it but I'm going to explain it on this one so I haven't really dry to normal skin but in the mornings my skin is really dry so I need a really thick moisturizer to keep my skin moisturized all day and not flaky and I've tried just using this moisturizer and it just hasn't done itI'd like mixed it with like other moisturizers and it's been well but just using this moisturizer alone it doesn't fully moisturize my skin so to say that I would say the rich version it I definitely prefer more than than regular version just because I have really dry skin and this is not enough for me however if you have normal to oily skin I would definitely recommend this over the rich it's just I have really dry skin
