rebeccaramsdale reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: so this is the glossier Invisible Shield which is there SPF it's a broad spectrum SPF of 35 this is by far one of my favorite SPS and I have tried a lot of them it is clear so it doesn't leave a white cast on your face and it's it's so well under makeup and just gives your skin this nice glowy look the one downside about this project is it is not available anywhere so if you are in the States you can get it but if you're in Canada you can't I just went to LA last week I tried to stock up but unfortunately they were corporately sold out so I'm going to try and make this a bit last
