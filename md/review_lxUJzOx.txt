harmonym reviews Haloscope by Glossier: this is the glossy Halo scope and I absolutely adore this product from Lost really good underrated products in my opinion the things that I love about this is it is again kind of a wet looking highlights similar to the tower 20 just this one is a little bit more glowy and less like Dewey and wet as this one but I do think it gives a very natural wet looking effect on this is not helpful. But without adding a lot of color or Shimmer anything like that and it comes in a very convenient stick form and I would say that it'll last you a while and I think that it's worth the price if you're looking for something that's a natural glowy dewy highlighter than this is perfect for you
