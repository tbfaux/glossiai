_emilymarie reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: this is my little car lip kit and today I'm going to review glossier balm.com this is just that OG original I really love this because I feel like it's a lot thicker than others like any of the other flavors like birthday or anything so it's super thick and you can use it for more than just your lips which I love specially in the winter like I'll get in my car and just slaughtered us on my lips or my cuticles or anything that's just super dry and then it's just amazing in the packaging is really cute and yeah love the stuff
