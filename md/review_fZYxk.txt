hellojewlie reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: today I want to review a product I'm actually not that big of a fan of and it's this glossier zit stick talk about the things I do like about this product 5% benzoyl peroxide and I believe it has 2% salicylic acid in it as well I love the packaging it's super convenient you can throw it in your bag take it on the go it's easy for travel and I like that you have this clicker that dispenses the perfect amount of product and it's very sanitary however this is packaged to go because it promises that you can layer it Under and Over makeup for seamless wear and I have not found that the case I find that under or over makeup this completely pills and I ruined countless days of makeup trying to use this product in that way and additionally I find it extremely drying on my skin to the point where my skin will peel off if I use this more than one day in a row so even though it's cute I just don't think it's worth it
