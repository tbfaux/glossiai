Lolamae33 reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: okay so I have the glossier priming moisturizer it's really good it feels full and if you have more oily or dry skin you can build it for oily you only have to use a little and for dry you can take some and build this it it feels really nice on it and doesn't have a scent just get if your senses sense and it looks like that and it feels really really good so I really like it and it has ingredients that won't hurt your skin the number one ingredient is water so that means you can that means it's very light so you can build it up more and this is one of my favorite products from glossier a so I give it a nine on ten
