ava1818 reviews Glossier set Lip Gloss and Lash Slick by Glossier: the right here we have the glossy a in the color Shimmer it's really pretty good it's really sticky but I actually do like that and it doesn't last long I think it's a great price for the money it's cute packaging to you know you get the two free samples so definitely worth your money and I definitely like this one as a clear one Sparkle definitely you should buy this one instead of the Patrick, if you want to clear with Shimmer definitely worth your money go by
