Taliamapili reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: guess what I'm trying to say that's where I'm trying out my shirt I got from Target is $5 it's honestly kind of Tides a size medium in these type of shirts for wild Fable or whatever it is a target there like we are a size small in shirts so I'm the other cop talk about from Target or white shirt I bought it in large because it was too small and extra small is so tight so this is really tight but it's going to work anyways I made this review to say about my cousin and her best friend annoying Hannah I'll put they're at in comments and tag them on here they finally made a freaking supergate review I feel like 5 million years getting but it was like 3 months or something since they made a super great review so hopefully go watch their beds and hopefully they can do we have some videos but hopefully they can get their first Super a package one of these daysso cuz like they are missing out I was like guys why do you go and buy makeup still you can literally get it for free from Super grade so
