milamenges reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: hi guys this is the glossier moisturizing Moon mask got a little cute art thing on the top of it but it looks like this it's kind of like a good cream almost instead of a mask but I used it the other day and I think it did hydrate and moisturize my face a lot and I really liked it and I think you leave it on for 20 minutes so that's a really nice mask if you just want to relax and not have to do too much Sophia
