allthedew reviews Futuredew by Glossier: so much you're so surprised I haven't reviewed the glossy a future do yet and I do have to say I do enjoy it but I do enjoy it has a priming luminizer stab not so much as the last step of my skincare they say to put it on after serums moisturizer SPF than this I personally don't really enjoy using it that way I just like it if I want a little bit of glow under my makeup so I have one bump under my hand as you can see it definitely gives you that like I just did all of my skin care of culo I really love it but just know that sensitive skin types be wary of the fact that this has Rosemary extract which could be very irritating offered some sensitive skin tight so but I personally like it as a makeup step not so much as a skin care steps so that's his personal preference I like to use one pump they recommend to I think two is too much but I definitely say one really looks beautiful
