lila223 reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: hello I'm just going to do a quick review on this glossy hair product it's priming moisturizer I'm not a huge fan of glass here but I really like this product becomes this cute little containers with very reminiscent of lavender and it's super rich and it works as a primer to I would recommend it if you have like dry to mix skin if you have oily skin I wouldn't recommend it cuz it's once again it's very rich and yeah I would recommend it
