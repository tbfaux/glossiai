butterandbeauty reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: I think for you and it's basically my favorite body moisturizer lotion cream of all time I am obsessed with the smell which is Orange Blossom and Neroli and couple other scent ingredients it is a pretty powerful fragrance in terms of like the strength in the product so if you're sensitive to fragrance either skinwise or just fragrant being out your nose you might want to consider reconsider this but if you're okay with that and you like the scent this is amazing I'm going to show up at my armjust a bit here and it goes on instantly you can you can barely even tell his much are even though he's a bit of a shimmer but like a very more of a Ximena Shimmer so yeah I really love this and it's my absolute favorite
