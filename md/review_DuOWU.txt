guccigab reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so today I want to be reviewing the glossier balm.com I have it to shade the rose and the Cherry the to tinted Shades and these retail for $12 on the website so the rose one is just a very pink light pink tents this is what it looks like it doesn't show up that well on my lips but it does have a little bit of a tense and the Cherry one has more of a red tent so that one does she want more and I just really like these because they're tinted ChapStick and they are all similar to vaseline wear it like keeps your lips moist and not like sticky or anything like that so they are really nice they're a little expensive since they are $12 each but there you can buy three 4:30 so I can you save $6
