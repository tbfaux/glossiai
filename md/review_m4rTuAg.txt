mzudsiri reviews Hand Cream by Glossier: I purchase the glassy hand cream as soon as it came out I've been using it pretty much on and off every day since I got it I purchased two I really love the package thing it is just the most fun unique experience for a hand cream in a long time I love that it just resembles like a lighter I like the scent which is the signature you sent I personally don't wear that you favor and just because to me it's not unique enough and I like to wear perfume that people don't necessarily recognize that just my perfume preference and this I actually really enjoyed because I almost purchased the Chanel hand cream which I believe is like $50 maybe more and I just couldn't swallow that price tag for hand cream and I feel like the glossy one does that feel bad boy for me so well that I just don't even think about getting Michelle one at all
