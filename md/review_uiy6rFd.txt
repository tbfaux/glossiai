allthatskincaress reviews Colorslide by Glossier: so this is the God's a color slide in Brock it's their darkest color it's just their up brown and as you can see I've used quite a bit of it I love this just to lie my upper eye line instead of using like a liquid eyeliner the color is so beautiful and the chip right here is super creamy but it actually is so creamy that it falls off if you don't use the right sharpener so I'm going to review Good Shepherd hours for this product in my next video but absolute favorite eyeliner even though it's a little too creamy up here I just love coffee and general will definitely be reproduced repurchasing and I kind of want to try out some other colors just to be a little bit more playful I wish they came up with a black in this as well but I do understand what they want
