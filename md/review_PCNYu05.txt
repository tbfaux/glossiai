dancer2007 reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hi guys so today I'm reviewing the Milky jelly cleanser by glass CA okay so this actually is not a bad product this product just maintained clear skin so this does not help us like clearing up acne or anything so there's no like really bad products and Ness and I definitely like recommended if you have good or like clear skin already and I did not recognize product and I sensitive skin to what I was saying is there's not any bad products but there's not any products that are like tutu good like they got help your skin too much there is blood good product good ingredients in here but like none of them are outstanding ingredients so yeah if you have clear skin and just want a cleanser that is light and just helps maintain good and clear skin I definitely recommend this also it's good for its price
