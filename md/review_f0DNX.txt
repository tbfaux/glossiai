abooogie_ reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: can I see lots of mixed reviews on this I've heard that makes people break out a sense of things so what I did is I would get a trial packet every time we order glass CA which is pretty often so I was using those for about two weeks I like it I think that it makes my skin feel very moisturize very nourish it's nice and soft and light and it kind of just Blends right into your skin and I just really love it so far I got tons of compliments on my skin and it was after I started using this device has compliments every time I post a picture where everyone's like why your skin looks amazing you know and this this is why this is really why so I think that it's worth trying get the trial size and or the trial pack it I'm sorry and try it out so you can sell your skin reacts to it cuz I was skeptical at first because of the reviews but I ended up really liking it a lot so
