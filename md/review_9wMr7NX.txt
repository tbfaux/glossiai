sophiejavelona reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey y'all today I'm doing a review on the bomb.com trios if you can get them individually but I got them in a trio I got birthday chick. Coconut first up we got birthday and this one out of the three of them I think this one has the best has it's clear but I have a little bit of a shimmer an inhaler and ask about coconut and this one also has a shimmer I think this one's the most moisturizing out of all of them and lemon taste pretty good next one I got was cherry and this one is one with like a reddish tint the obvious moisturize your lips and they can moisturize your skin and the Cadillac lip gloss and ChapStick but together and really bombed cool
