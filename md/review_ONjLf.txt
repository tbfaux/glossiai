tialaurynn reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys I am going to be viewing the Milky jelly facial cleanser by glossy a so this cleanser is a part of my everyday night time makeup routine whenever I wear makeup I normally go with a face rag first and then whatever that makeup wipe doesn't get then I go in with the Milky jelly I still have some under my eyes out here that needs it all cuz I haven't used it yet but I really like this because it helps to get any excess makeup off at your makeup wipe couldn't get and it also helps to get like underneath your skin cells to it like cleans underneath to knit conditions your face and makes it feel really smooth after so once I use this I just wash it right off but some was rather on and then I'm ready for bed
