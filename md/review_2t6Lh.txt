harmonym reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: oh my gosh I really realized this help my method what time is okay today I'm here to talk about policy stretch concealer I'm back better than ever we're going to make my room be today so let me tell you when I say that this is my favorite concealer know I love a lot of other concealers drugstore or high-end but this is one consumer that I find it nothing compares to it the thing about this is that it does not crease it's moisturizing and it does not crease yet it's the perfect amount of coverage so when I put this on under my eyes it's meant to move with your face instead of Kris with your face it moves in the spots that you put it so that it doesn't crease it stays flowy with your skin and it gives the perfect amount of coverage that keeps her face looking natural but it's able to cover blemishes under eye circles or anything that you don't want any redness it's a perfect amount of coverage and they have it in a lot of really pretty shape ISO recommend this
