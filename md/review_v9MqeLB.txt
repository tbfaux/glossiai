emilyyy reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey I'll be showing you the texture of the mango bomb.com from glossy a it's also how I think I'm just going to rub it on the back so you can see Week 1 the color of the bomb is a little pink it's a little cool color when you applied on to your lipstick is it a low Coral tent it's really nice misspells really good but I really don't think it's worth like $15 but other than that I really do like it
