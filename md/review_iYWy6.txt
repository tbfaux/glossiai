bbygurlvane reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: so this is a review and a demo of the shade Phantasm I actually have Phantasm and glass Bonsai here they are and with flash this one is definitely more of a holographic color but it has a clear base and this one it is a little bit cleared as well but it does have finer Glitters so it does kind of have more of a yellow gold base I have been applying them with the little silicone applicator that they come within the playground set or in the duo and I really love them and they're so easy to apply wherever you place it really stays there's zero Fallout it doesn't burn my eyes and I do have sensitive eyes that you get irritated by like liquid eyeliner or so I think that these are a great product for high-end pots but it's like super easy and I really love this color
