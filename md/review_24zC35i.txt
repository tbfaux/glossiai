mayareviews reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: PayPal so glossy milky oil I love this product have talked about it before but I wanted to go through kind of my nighttime skincare routine and this would be the first step if I had one makeup or even if not if I just felt like my skin was oily and needed to draw out that oil with some oil cuz it's kind of like a magnet so this will be my first step It's very effective so there you go is super effective super easy to use makeup remover it is hydrating so it helps like be like a pre Step 2 cleanser so that the cleanser doesn't strip YouTube
