rania reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: I see you made it with me to work and I'm going to be reviewing the gloss VA lip gloss today but I love to look want to cuz it's not too sticky I could do a nice shine yeah and it lasts for a long time to get a bottle that's like this big and it says that it is quaint 14 fluid ounces I think that's a good size 14 dollars the only thing I don't like is really funky and growth as he is it which is something that most losses through and ask her again a better way for you can see how can I get some coffee and growth on the lips it still looks pretty good but in the bottle is kind of gross product
