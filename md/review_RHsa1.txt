joellehyman reviews Wowder by Glossier: I want to do this in real time and then do my makeup and this is one of my favorite products think it's kind of underrated so I'll show you how to use it this is the inside Contraptions kind of in with the powder you can shake it or you can tap your brush on it and I will do that now using a really big face brush I like the one that comes with it but this one moves a little faster when I do this I go at my forehead don't knows not a cute face to make buttthis is how it gets done the best part about this really is the net I really like the powder is buildable so throughout the day I'm stirring some concealer and powder and I do have nice friends here and it's buildable so all day if you had a little more oily you can touch it up
