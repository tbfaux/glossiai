haulsbyisa reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: today I'm going to be doing a review for the coconut bomb.com by glossy a so if you're looking for a great lip balm to get this would be a really good choice because it smells exactly whatever the flavor is cuz I have multiple of them and if you just smell them for what they're labeled it smells exactly like that so you don't worry about getting a weird scent when you're trying to buy like watermelon this smells exactly like coconut and it feels amazinglet's put it on a lot of shine and it's super smooth on your lips so it just it's just amazing so if you're looking for a lip balm I really recommend this one
