kmorgans reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey guys so I'm going to be reviewing D glossier stretch concealer okay so if you watched my last review I talked about the Nars Tinted Moisturizer so I have that phone right now and all I do this is I just kind of throw my finger on the pot and literally just dab around my eye so moisturizing it doesn't really kreese the color is nice that goes on very well like you can put this on like when you have no makeup on and it would still look super nice so I don't know if you can tell a difference it's definitely like brighter on this side here let me take you take you to the better lighting but you can definitely tell like this side looks a lot oh my glory brighter I just I love that stuff it's so nice
