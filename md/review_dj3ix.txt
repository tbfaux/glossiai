kelseylynne reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so this is glossier Rose balm.com in the new mango said and it is seriously amazing the color is a nice Peach and it's a super smooth consistency that rubs right into your lips leaving them super hydrated I'm a huge fan of anything lost yeah but this mango scent is truly amazing it smells just like a mango Hi-Chew and leaves your lips super moisturize throughout the day you can also use this product anywhere that needs a little bit more hydration I like to use it on the sides of my nose just because it gets a little dry over there on my cuticles excetera I've tried almost all of the bomb.com sense and this one is for sure my new favorite
