oliviahickly reviews Haloscope by Glossier: Minecraft CIA I probably need help so I'll see your halo scope I bought this around the time I got my lodestar and Genji's which I will also be reviewing and I hated it I was like wow this is a most awful thing ever it's so gross and transparent has absolutely no glow whatsoever so I literally did not work for two weeks and then I'm finally one day I was like you know what her go again and I don't know what I didn't like about her the first time and put it on this is amazing I love the way this makes my skin look and now he's at every day and I probably could not live without it and I just take my finger and debit on in there then debit on my high points and I just use you like a nice glossy not over glittery glow and I'm considering purchasing the other two shades for like eyeshadow because I love this one so much
