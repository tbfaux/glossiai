gabil reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: this is a foxy a birthday balm.com the packaging is gorgeous and has holographic glitter at the top has yellow color with very tiny Glitters it smells and tastes very good but it is a very hydrating on the lips a better option in my opinion is the lanolips 101 ointment as it is more hydrating overall overall I really like the scent and taste of this product I don't think it is the most hydrating lip balm
