han reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: okay this might be a little bit of a hot cake on body hero but it's really not my favorite product it's very thick which is nice but it doesn't absorb quickly so then it's just kind of thick layer on your skin even if you put it on damp skin or you put it on dry skin like either one it doesn't absorb very quickly for me and the scent is very strong it's not my favorite and I don't think that is accurate how they described it I don't think that's what it smells like which I guess is not their fault like it's fine but honestly like a solid 3 out of 5 it's really not the best sorry but
