mads_beauty reviews Wowder by Glossier: he's eyes so I'm going to do a quick review on glossy Wonder powder so I really love this for me it's a staple I always have it in my makeup routine as you can see is also a loss on time for the still law in there and you don't need that much honestly and there's like it gets pretty good coverage it's and it's supernatural looking so I would highly recommend getting it and again you might say oh but it's so pricey yeah it is a little bit but if you think about how long it lasts like this is probably last me a year and maybe a little bit over a year and it's such a staple in your makeup routine I mean like who doesn't use powder and this is also in the shade g910 so yeah I highly recommend getting it if you're there in light skin like me that I would recommend getting that shade
