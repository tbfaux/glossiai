destinylb reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys so today I got my first glossier package as you can see I've already put on one of my cloud paint I put on storm it is really dark it was so easy to blend no I'm going to try to add Puffs to it to lighten it up those are the only two colors I got but we'll see how this goesso overall I really like these they Blended very well and match together if you do want to blame these together be very careful whenever you first opened them because storm exploded but is really easier lighting up and I.
