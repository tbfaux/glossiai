Super Glow by Glossier: For that “lit from within” look. Vitamin C brightens and Magnesium energizes for days when you didn’t get enough sleep or skin looks sallow. Like when you’re browsing Instagram after dinner and suddenly it’s 4am. Over time, Super Glow evens skin tone, and creates a light-reflective complexion. The water-like texture immediately absorbs into skin without a trace—use all over face, after cleanser, before moisturizer. Super Glow is an integral part of The Supers squad: three concentrated serums to refill your skin’s deficiencies, strengthening it day after day.
