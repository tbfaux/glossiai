lifewcourt reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: crossy roads slick mascara what the water looks like are literally invisible we don't have life is we need help here's my eyelashes after I didn't call them so they're very like straight sell but like you can see there's something there at least personally I love his hair just like every day because it like helps with lengthening and like keeping my lashes separated but it doesn't give me like that dramatic Locker doesn't volumize them so it's good for just like day-to-day or running errands, thing also I will say it's not waterproof but I've never had it so much on me personally I'm not sure if others have but I haven't yet I literally don't know how glossy does it they never disappoint me I love all their products
