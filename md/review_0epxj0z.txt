TessWambui reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: okay so this is definitely my go-to sunscreen isn't the glass CA Invisible Shield it is 35 SPF and it literally is clear like you put this on and it's super clear and it leaves your skin with the nice very nice glue it is a chemical sunscreen so there is no white cast out there for you guys if you're wondering and the packaging is super cute it does have a slight citrusy smell but nothing too overbearing and it when you apply it in Cletus appears so yeah I would highly recommend this sunscreen it is one fluid ounce
