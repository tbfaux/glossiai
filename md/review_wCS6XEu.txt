beautybymonamarie reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey everyone this is my contest entry to Savannah's challenge for the eager look I'm just finishing by securing these lashes there the velour Lashes in the style Flawless and these are one of my favorites of use these about 10 times they've held up really well and they're really really pretty so my favorite part of this challenge was definitely layering on the blush I use the glossier cloud paint and puff and storm mixed and then on top of that I went super ham with The Hourglass Cosmetics ambient lighting blush quad and ghosts I just mixed all together and went over top and the most difficult part I found to be where the faux freckles I use a Mac shape and shade brow tint and tapered it's an eyebrow pen and I did one layer and then went over to tone them down with my foundation brush and then another layer on top to have different capacities for a really natural look
