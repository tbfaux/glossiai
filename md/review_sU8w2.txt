lizzyd14 reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: hey guys it's a I'm going to be trying the glossier's that stick I've never purchased anything from glossy and I did get this message reminds I'm so excited to try it out it came with these awesome stickers to and I love them so it took me a mini twists and turns to get the product out but I finally did and I do like the rollerball I do think it adds a nice little touch and I do like the very industrially but girly up five going on and so far I really like it I think it's to prepare for sending me this and I will do a follow-up review it to make sure that I do really really like it because right now I really really love it
