hadleyyaya reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hi friends so today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier perfecting skin tint I think that's Canton is a really good name for this because it's definitely not really a foundation or anyting it really doesn't have much coverage at all but it does help slightly even out your skin tone a little bit and it definitely makes you relieve Dewey so it's good for people who really likes like a natural look they don't really want to look like they're wearing anything on their skin like this is a great product for that so I wanted you guys to get a sense of the coverage so I'm going to take it I'm going to put a few dots on my cheektap it out so yeah as you can see pretty much everything is still like visible in terms of blemishes but it does help even out skin tone and give a really nice to eat
