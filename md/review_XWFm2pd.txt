tangomango reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: Par 3 in the last part of my glossier brand review so this is glass a boy brow hold on this come off so fast and I looked at some of the reviews and a lot of people said the same thing about evic label coming off the packaging is not cute with this phone but does it really matter it's just not my hair product it doesn't really do much and I feel like you could get something way that things like $18 something like that you could definitely need to find a really easy do for this and that around by would not repurchase that we have these dipstick not a fan of this product it's literally doesn't even work I like how it has like a little roller ball thing you just like you twisted up and then put on your face but packaging ugly and it doesn't work so I would not recommend or repurchase over all this rain has it's like a hit or miss some products or goods from producer bad but overall I would never purchase in them again as I said before and probably would give it like a for the product like a 7 out of 10 and for the brand a 0 out of 10
