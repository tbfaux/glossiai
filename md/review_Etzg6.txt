hales412 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I guess going with the theme of glossier products and another one that I really love is the Rose balm.com and obviously it's in the centros it's pink you can see it right there and honestly it's not just a lip balm says it's Universal skin Salve it's literally bad like I use this on my elbows if they're ashy this is it stink smell like roses smells really good and yeah it isn't as much color but it is very moisturizing it feels so smooth on your lips like and it lasts for you no good amount of time like you don't have to keep reapplying it I love
