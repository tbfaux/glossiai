ontheglowNYC reviews Wowder by Glossier: this is the glossier wowder duo is very cool soda brand actually gives out these little stickers to decorate your products deserve cool and this is in the shade light medium and has his sort of trampoline bed to get the powder out so this is a super lightweight finishing powder you won't really see too much but I definitely recommend it for people who have oily skin cuz it just absorbs all the oil this is definitely a fordable and worth the money so Erica Mendez
