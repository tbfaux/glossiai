So I got the glasses elastic so I'm going to be reviewing it take a like the last girl I'm going to be reviewing it because I am super into it so first of all. Packaging is so pretty this is what it looks like so I'm going to try it out okay so this is what it looks like on oh my gosh you guys I really like it's super nice it doesn't Clump and it separates your lashes really well I really like the one cuz it's super sturdy so it doesn't move around when you're like rolling out your lashes it is $60 so it's not too bad it is kind of pricey for a mascara but it's classy and most classiest of his expensive but this was one of the cheaper product so that's why I had it on my list but yeah I really like this I would highly recommend it plus you get cute with sticker and bag with your Packaging
