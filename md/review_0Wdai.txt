butterandbeauty reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: this is the new ich classy a milky oil is a eye makeup remover supposed to leave a good for a waterproof eye makeup I'm not going to sit on the camera but I have used us both on regular eye makeup and waterproof and it definitely does work I'm just not a huge fan of the feeling of like most oil eye makeup remover is it feels kind of greasy to me I adore the original milky jelly cleanser this just wasn't great I usually use a via driver or micellar water and I much prefer that but if you do wear waterproof mascara that I can I would definitely recommend this it's $12 and it's quite small but you really only need to use like a tight like a couplepumps Sports whatever you want to call it as you see it separated and you shake it and it's mixed like that and yeah but I wouldn't say it's bad either
