oliviahickly reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier Milky jelly cleanser this is my favorite cleanser that I've ever tried it's super hydrating and doesn't strip your skin but I feel like a lot of cleansers do you so I really appreciate that I have a dry day like acne-prone skin type so this is a really good cleanser for me and I love the scent of it it's like a really gentle like rose scent it's not super overpowering the texture of it is really nice and it's not foaming which I like it's very like jelly and you only need a little bit and it takes off all your makeup like all of it every last bit it's so good and it's only $18 which I think is pretty affordable because a lot of cleansers are like super sensitive like Tasha like drunk elephant so this one's really affordable and good and I definitely recommend it is a tad tan love it yeah yeah
