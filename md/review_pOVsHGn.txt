zxm2000 reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: everyone so today I'm going to be doing a review on the Milky jelly cleanser buy glossier for me I feel like it isn't for me cuz it has like a little bit too much fragrance and as you know fragrances are really good for your skin and it can be very harsh for your skin so like that is one reason why I wouldn't recommend it and I feel like I lost years early a good friend either overall because they have too many harsh chemicals and they used Too Much fragrance which is bad for you so like yeah I feel like I would recommend this if you like would like a lot of fragrans I don't know but me personally so how a little bit with sensitive skin not really but sometimes like my skin gets really sensitive I feel like I feel like I wouldn't use it personally
