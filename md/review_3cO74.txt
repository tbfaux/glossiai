clairewalter reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: power on the topic of shower products this is one of my very very very favorite ones I hate when I run out and I tried to always have a backup in my cabinet this is the class a body hero oil wash it's about 8 and 1/2 oz last a very long time has Neroli in it so it smells incredible and even though you wash it off the scent stays on you I use the body hair wash everywhere in my body it's been tested by gynecologist so it's safe to use anywhere on your body even sensitive areas it emulsifies well so it gets Sunday when you're putting it on and then as soon as you put it under the water to wash it off it just goes right away and doesn't leave any sticky residue or anything it just leave your skin feeling soft and clean I also use it to shave I had a very hard time shaving when I ran out last month
