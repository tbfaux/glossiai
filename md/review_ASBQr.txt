valeriasernag reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I've had this for a while now but I hadn't open it so let's see what the hype is all about I love how cute it is let's see if it lives up to the hype so I usually a plate on my finger cuz I don't like the applicator very ghost boy has glitter oh my God now I get it in cells have an amazing smell I just want to eat it plus it looks a different finish than other bone. Comes as it's kind of shimmery which I love
