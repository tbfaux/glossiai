mayareviews reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hey friend swimmer viewing glossier's milky oil super excited about this it's my first time using it I'm just removing my makeup from the day so let's see how it works my skin feels great that was super good on sensitive skin like it didn't feel irritating at all it felt super smooth coming off I honestly highly recommend I think this is my new favorite remover I think I do have to go in and do a little bit more with it but honestly I really love that I love the milky oil e texture of it like it's just super shooting on skin and super soft and just Glides off
