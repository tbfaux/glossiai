priscilla reviews Wowder by Glossier: this is water and I want to talk about it I have the shade light medium in this router and I love it I think it works perfectly for my skin complexion as you can see it this is how much about her I have left which is almost nothing I've been using this every day since it's come out and it is honestly the best I love this because for hazardous knitting area and it doesn't slap me in the face every time I open it or get my brush and I don't have like powder just like going everywhere if it falls also I love I love that about this and it just works really good for me so finally mailed it has no scent it doesn't make me look cakey at all as you can see I have it on today under my eyes and I still think that it looks pretty and glowy if anything and yeah I think it's great
