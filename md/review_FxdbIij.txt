clare0b reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: here is the absolutely iconic glossier Cloud paint in the shade dusk this is very new to my collection of used it a handful times but my goodness it is stunning really you only have to use a tiny tiny tiny bit I put it on my hand. It was my finger and just apply it like that you're done in like 5 seconds and it's super blendable surprisingly pigmented and the shade in particular perfect if you just want like a natural sort of sunburn plush so highly recommend
