mollia716 reviews Colorslide by Glossier: so this is glossy a play color slide in the shade pretty penny this is what it looks likes washed on my hand so it's got a beautiful copper color with little gold flecks in there until I see them and I also put on my eyes so this was pretty easy to put on it supposed to be I think water resistant or waterproof so we'll see how I have to see how it holds up and I think the pigmentation is really amazing and so far I'm pretty impressed and I really want to try out the other colors
