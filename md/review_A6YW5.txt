Franthebee reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so I'm going to review the lip gloss by glossier I literally just I open this and put it on I have it on my lips right now this is like the best lip gloss I've I've ever tried I'm normally not a lip gloss person like I'm normally like a Mad Lib for a girl but this has like change my mind like look at that look at how shiny and pretty my lips look like now and this is just one coat of this stuff it's of course it's a little sticky I mean it's a boss I don't know any lip glosses that aren't sticky and it's super shiny as you can see and it's just so pretty late look at this packaging is simple but gorgeous and they also have it available until it fades but I really like this this is like might want to get the right one now five out of five stars
