Bmak0324 reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys so here I have glossier's Cloud paint and puff on this is a seamless cheek color as they describe it is a liquid blush here it is on my hand and this is way too much for your cheeks like for both cheeks that is a tip that I have is it comes out very fast I usually open and don't even squeeze I just tap the top of it and there's enough tent to put on my cheeks but I really like this color as a really nice blushy pink color
