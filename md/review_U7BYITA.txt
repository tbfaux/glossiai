legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Futuredew by Glossier: hey super great so this is a sample of glossier futuredew it's an oil serum hybrid so I have just put this on all over my face I have nothing on except the oil serum hybrid so that the future do my lashes are done with mascara and have a lipstick on that's it nothing else so this is not as bright as I thought it was which I mean considering the glossier's a more natural looking makeup brand I think this works is when you put the serum out like on your hand it actually has a little Sparks of like glitter or pigment or something that you can see it was a little worried about what I was going to do to my face but I don't actually see it once it's on like I feel like you just get a very natural-looking close this would be really great on days when you don't put up any other makeup on I am going to put makeup on now like other like foundation and stuff so let's see I will make another video as to how that holds out once it's in a Cupboard
