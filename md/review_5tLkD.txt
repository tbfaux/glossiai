dinamamnev reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: so I tried the glossier Milky jelly cleanser and honestly did not love it doesn't take your makeup off at all it's the most gentle cleanser that you'll ever find and it takes blank 10 pumps to cleanse your face so I didn't love that and the smell is like not great either so
