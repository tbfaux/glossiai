andymae reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I have to be classy very bomb.com the packaging is super cute even in the inside it has a nice blue tint when you pull out this is the actual lip gloss basically it's kind of like Vaseline but this one is tempted and it lasts a lot longer I think it's worth it if you get the tinted ones only because then it looks like you're wearing a light lip gloss and should have just chapstick
