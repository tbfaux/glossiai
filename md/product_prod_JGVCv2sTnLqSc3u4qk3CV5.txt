Colorslide by Glossier: Introducing the 14 new-to-you, color-true shades to add to your makeup bag. Colorslide is the eyeliner where what you see on the pencil is exactly what you get. Plus, a waterproof formula that dreams are made of: a highly pigmented, smooth gel eyeliner that doesnâ€™t crease, smudge, tug, or skip and lasts for 12 hours (matte shades last in the waterline for 8 hours), leaving you to create freely. Draw something new with a pencil that lasts all day and all night.
