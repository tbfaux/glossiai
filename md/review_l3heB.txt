sarahjgomez reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so I wanted to tell you guys about my favorite everyday concealer which is the glossy a stretch concealer I'm in the shade Medium as you can see there is a quite big dent in here because I just love it that much of course it's not entirely full coverage its glossy it's a no makeup makeup look so it's definitely not expected to be full coverage but it does cover under eye bags so amazingly as you can see it look so much brighter under my eyes on that side this is very hydrating lawsuit is that do we sorta brand so I do like to set this with a little bit of wowder occasionally not all the time because right now it's winter but you should totally get this it is my favorite concealer although there is a lot of Shades I think they're very flexible
