discobeautie reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: okay so I just bought the glossy 8 invisibleSHIELD so it's SPF 35 and I got it cuz I knew I'd be out in the summer more this summer and I know you're supposed to actually wear sunscreen everyday just to protect your skin so I wanted to start doing that and I just got it so I've only worn it once but it could I usually do like a couple pumps and it comes out just kind of I like it cuz it's not like super creamy so when it goes on your face it's not like white it's more like an almost like an oilso it really Blends into your skin without like leaving any residue and then it dries pretty quickly it smells kind of like sunscreen but not like super bad like normal sunscreen and like it so far
