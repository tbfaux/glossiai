Generation G by Glossier: I live near the showroom and decided to check it out on a weekend morning just as they opened (before the crowds). Purchased Lipstick in Zip color. I like sheer effortless lipsticks that give a little natural color. The color was fine - bright enough and not too orange and definitely not too blue. But the texture is hard and waxy so you do end up blotting off the waxy blobs. Also after several weeks in my purse - in a protected makeup bag - the lipstick has broken at the base so every time I open it sticks to the lid. Also the tube is cracked and the lettering is wearing off. Not great packaging. I think Iâ€™ll stick to Lipstick Queen Medieval which is superior.
