ClareBrownell reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys I'm back again to review the glossy a Milky jelly cleanser I really really like this cleanser I feel like it's a pretty good price for the amount that you do use although some people say it might be overpriced I don't think so because it looks like you don't get a lot but you really do cuz I only use about three pumps and I mean I would say that less than three pumps goes a long way I really love this to use as a second face wash just kind of to moisturize the skin it doesn't really take off a full face of makeup but I really like it because it's great for sensitive skin and it really helps to moisturize your skin and it doesn't have fragrance so yeah
