alleex reviews Futuredew by Glossier: in my opinion future do is the absolute best product glossy a has ever come out with this is an oil serum hybrid so it does have that very plush bouncy texture that leaves your skin looking crazy do we if you're into this kind of glossy skin water lines sweaty look that I am super duper into then you need to pick this up I have not tried anything that gives a more natural glowy finish to the skin I love to use this as a primer generally I will go in with one and a half to two pumps and that is definitely more than you need but I just love how hydrating and Lush this feels on the face and bonus points for coming in the absolute prettiest pearlescent pink bottle
