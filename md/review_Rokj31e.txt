beautybymonamarie reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey everyone I'm so excited because my Frenchie climb just came in and I've been waiting for this couldn't wait I put it on already this is how it looks on my skin and on my list I have it on over the tower 28 superdude highlighting balm my daughter's arriving off the bus hold on all right this was a super great job so thank you super great for this reward I'm really excited because it's a very similar and consistency to the glossier cloud paint but this is a shade that I definitely don't have an any Cream Blush product so it's a very welcome addition to my collection here it's a warm terracotta shade it's a lot brighter than I thought it would be in person but it says she route to be like a really nice wash of color
