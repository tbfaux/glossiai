dryskinreviews reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: this is the glossier lip gloss and red as you can see in the tube it looks super bright red and kind of scary but I'm wearing it on my lips right now and you can see that it just kind of gives a subtle pink tint to it actually is not much color at all and makes your lips look wet which I like but if you don't want a super high shine that's probably not for you I'd also say that there is East light stick it's a kind of a sticky feeling when you have it on her lips it's not anything uncomfortable but if that's something you really hate in a lip gloss I would recommend getting it but overall I think it's nice the staying power is pretty good for a lip gloss not anything that great because it is Stila lip gloss but overall I would recommend it
