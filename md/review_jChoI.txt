rhoudeboy reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: hi everyone it's Anthony from Netflix is queer eye and welcome back to my page and today I'm going to be reviewing glossy plays glitter Chalet in the shade Bijou Bijou and I'm going to be using the detailer to apply it Bijou Bijou and which is an amazing name I am French for those who don't know I speak fluent to Francais and it's a sort of gold and Onyx and silver concoction of glitter it's really easy gel to just sort of take on and and build up on a look that you've already started I think so after that one swipe I sort of deliberately spread of the glitter around with the detailer as well as my finger and I think this product is super easy to use great application. There's a great power off with the glitter and it's tripping look at to wear with your friends like Jonathan or 10 or even just in the kitchen
