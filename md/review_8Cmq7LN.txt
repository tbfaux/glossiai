atkinsonchar reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so the next product that I have been loving recently is the glossier mint balm.com I use this as a lip balm I got it for Christmas so I just put a little onto my finger that much is good and this is pretty big and then I love the smell of the consistency the only thing that I don't like about it is the applicator but it is a universal bomb so it's not just for the lip so I understand why the applicator is like that but other than that I do like it
