butterandbeauty reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: I will find one of my favorite masks the glossier moisturizing Moon mask which I've kept in the fridge for an extra nice little bit of chill very thick creamy consistency and I can do this continue cuz I'm quick fix its Quick Fix I'm going to leave it on for 20 minutes and then wash it off this is after 20 minutes or 25 minutes away most of it has kind of absorb so I'm just going to wash the rest off quickly and then I'll show you the end result so everything is washed off my skin feels so soft and so hydrated this is by far my favorite hydrating mask ever really simple and yeah I love it I can't say enough good things about it I barely even feel the need to put on moisturizer I put on like a light one but other than that I'm good
