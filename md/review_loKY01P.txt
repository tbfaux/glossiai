TessWambui reviews Solution by Glossier: okay guys this is my favorite chemical exfoliant it's the glossy a solution is 4 fluid oz is it has a Chase VHS and phas like oh my goodness magic in a bottle I put this on and my skin is insulin glowing if you are new to experience I would recommend slowly introducing this into your routine so it's not overpowering but I use about once a day I'm especially when I have breakouts when I don't have breakouts I usually tend to it maybe twice a week so love this product Holy Grail of mine also the packaging is so cute look at all the detail amazing
