ariannaa reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: so I have had the lip lacquer vanilla clip for a while now and I want to give you some of my thoughts because if you did the first time I just received in to put it on and told you my natural thoughts so my thoughts are basically the same place you did a great job with this formula great job I love the way it feels my lips it's just amazing screaming it doesn't feel sticky even though it is high it says hi hi shine lip lacquer so it is pretty shining and I like the color a lot you push it by Pump It by pushing this and I really like it the only thing I have to say about it is that it gets all over the cap so that's not really in that very nice I do love the little spongy applicator it's amazing I love it
