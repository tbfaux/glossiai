naomiepp reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: glossier perfecting skin tint and shade G11 so I bought this product for the very first time after the Extended Stay in range and reformulation was released and I have to say and then wipe and very disappointed this makes my skin break out into little micro hives it just increases skin texture makes my skin feel really dry and because it is a perfecting skin tint those new issues are very obvious because there is no coverage whatsoever for this product it's kind of serves as a nice little bubbler which I would generally like but it causes all those other issues to plus it's very expensive for only one fluid ounce and I just for me it's not going to it's not going to work I'll probably going to get this to family member but I don't know let me know if there's other like skin tints that you've used that work cuz this just doesn't work for me
