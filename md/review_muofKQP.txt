LynnRose reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: I love this glossy lip gloss is just the clear kind of looks like it's a little pink 10-second isn't really go on pink tinted I would say juicy and clear liquid that not sticky at all but a little sensitive and I know that Essence makes a really good dupe for like $2 I want to see when I finish this I'm up every purchase I had it for quite a while just want to finish it
