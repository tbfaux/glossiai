ajadepaolo reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: what's up spook Ray I am reviewing the glossy a let me turn around for you guys the glossy a boy brow in shade black noir I already applied some on my eyebrow this one's the more shaped eyebrows you can see there's really no difference on this one I left like my top so you guys can kind of see natural it goes on and kind of like looks like your hair which is that's something that I absolutely love it doesn't smudge off it's definitely not as harsh as a pencil or Pomade definitely more of a natural Vibe and look it's super small compact in your purse yeah I just really love it it's super light. Nothing on which I also enjoy so it doesn't overpower when I'm not wearing any makeup which is. So I love it I love her so
