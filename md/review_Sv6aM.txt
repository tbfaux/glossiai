eliana reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: I feel like me and you really thick eyebrows and you don't really mean to fill them in that much pain just want to make sure that they're like end up this is fragile for you I just supplied it and you can see it doesn't look too intense or dark which I personally don't like my brows and it's super quick I want to fill in and then said it would ride out I just use this. I really like this and it's totally worth the hype song
