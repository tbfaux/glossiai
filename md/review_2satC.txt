valeriasernag reviews Solution by Glossier: today I'm going to talk about the glossy solution exfoliating skin perfector this is a combination of facets which makes it an exfoliating toner I actually try this for the first time and it started stinging so bad I had to take it off and I decided to give it another try a couple of days later the same happens and I actually woke up with redness and sensitivity and bumps on my skin I need to say that I have a really really strong skin I don't have oily skin sensitivity I don't have dryness so it's really weird for a pug to have a bad reaction on me so this is why I decided to stop using it I actually use the Pixi glow tonic which is kind of the same product but the piece doesn't have his reaction of me I actually love that product is one of my favorites so yes I wouldn't recommend it specially for sensible skin
