pergoddess reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so for a Holy Grail product it would have to be to go see are lip gloss like this is something that I use every day no matter what whether I'm wearing makeup not wearing makeup do my skincare routine whether I don't no matter what I'm always wearing this I'm going to show you how it looks so it's the standard doe foot applicator and it honestly gives me back in the day rollerball glass pipes not to sticking perfectoh so it doesn't dry out my lips out which is a big big thing because a lot of goes it seems super glossy but after about 20 minutes your lips are dry again so obviously it's just really sucking out one of the moisture this is a holy grail for me
