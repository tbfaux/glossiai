yolk reviews Body Hero Dry-Touch Oil Mist by Glossier: so as you can see I've use like a lot of it and so I'm going to review it now first things first I'm going to say that it smells amazing and I really wish cloth they would make a freaking perfume out of this to smell is Neroli and Orange Blossom is absolutely divine and that's like the only thing I like about it is the sense unfortunately I find that this is good for summer yes but it's not a big enough bottle to use all over your body and for the size it's also really expensive so text your why is its lightweight it's not too heavy on the skin being in the oil and I think the sent kind of Fades after a while when you put it on it doesn't last throughout the day and one more thing be careful when your hand is oily and you're holding this this will slip out of your hands
