mad3leine reviews Wowder by Glossier: okay today I'm reviewing wealthy is Wilder I have the lightest shade and I really like it I use as powder every morning I put it on top of my stretch concealer and it's a really great how to adjust modifies eye concealer it's that's it for the rest of the day I'm a very naturally oily person and this this last a few hours I usually like to reapply after like 3 or 4 hours or so but it does a great job you can also put it on bare skin to just mattifier complexion and like Blurry or poorit's not cakey doesn't make your skin look dry and the component is really nice okay so this is what the component looks like you just kind of roll your brush around here and then most of the product goes back through the mesh into the base then you get an even amount on your brush 10 out of 10
