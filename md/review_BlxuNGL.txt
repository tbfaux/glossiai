Style_with_Audrey reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: one of my favorite products from Galt CA is there bomb.com I love the packaging I think a lot of us are drawn to the brand because of the packaging but this one is the berry flavor it actually smells like a berry candy and they comes out in very scary looking like dark purple color but once you get it on your lips it's not bad at all and once you plan it out it just adds a little bit of a sheer purple 18 to our lives which I love the only Annoying Thing is my hands will always get like a shiny layer of bomb that I need to like wash it off that's the only downside but otherwise I love this product and it's just so cute to put in your handbag
