mimosa reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: today I'm going to be using my glossy perfecting skin tint in G11 although I should probably be in G10 I've had this for a really long time I know a lot of people don't like it because it's more of like a skin perfector then any kind of coverage but I feel as though it really moves my skin out without covering my freckles and it kind of looks like a nice filteras you can see I have a lot of red marks and scars right now from my acne but I think it covers it up really well I mean you can still see it but it feels really light like kind of like a water text her and I really love the finished that it gives me and it just looks like skin it's undetectable it's not cakey at all and damn
