jules_r0se reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so I have laid out in front of me all of the glossy balm.com I recently just kind of pain impulses ordered all of them I had the roads one before but I and I had had the birthday cake one but I lost this one anyway but I just want to do a quick little review I just want to say I love all of them honestly I can't get enough if there were more flavors I would order them I'm currently these three are my favorite I really like the flavor of this month I like the tint on this one and I love the Shimmer on this one it's not scratchy cuz I was kind of worried you know when something has glitter in it I'm worried that it can be scratchy but it's like super soft on your lips and it tastes really good so yeah
