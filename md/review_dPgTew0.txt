Saltyyysab reviews Generation G by Glossier: okay so first I'm running my lips I think I finished actually with the next London lip liner thing and I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about the generation gee by glossy am honestly really like it I have two shades but today I'm going to be using fuzz and just putting it on my lips I know I put on lipstick or whatever this is so weird feel like I feel like you're just a really natural tone and I really like it like it just it's very pretty and the color matches me pretty well so I think I give it up five out of five so definitely recommend I will try it out or if you can answer for I don't know or has it but yeah
