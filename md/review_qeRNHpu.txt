teresapecher reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: hey guys this is actually my first video I'm Teresa and so I'm going to be reviewing the glossy as it stick I actually had a really high hopes for this but it was just honestly disappointing basically you just take it and you crank this little thing at the bottom here and it comes out the temp with the product and you just kind of like roll it on to the spots that you have that you want to take care of and it really just doesn't do anything I mean I've used it for over a week now on different spots and I just didn't notice any difference I mean it's fun to use but it is there's just no difference to be honest but yeah the active ingredient is 5% benzoyl peroxide and I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a good acne medication or not but it just honestly it was a big letdown for me so I would say pass on this one
