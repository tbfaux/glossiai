courtneyy reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: so now that I'm pretty much empty in this file monkey jelly I thought I would go back and do a review showing the progress that my skin is made while using it and I swear by the stuff I can get rid of my screen completely and I definitely recommend it before you say Mochi jelly my skin with breakouts I wrote once a week and pimples like these ones very big and painful and then at the beginning of using morphe gel play my forehead broke arrows and I think it was just a clearing out all the junk so here's my skin now and if you've been watching my videos and so you could see the progress that's been made since the beginning I use it twice a day one pump in the night I use it with my electric version in the morning I just use it regular for the most I'll get it now in regards to pimples or just these little poor is here that little one right there and that's about it for all these months using it
