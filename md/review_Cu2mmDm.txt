beautybymonamarie reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: glossier birthday balm.com it totally smells just like a grape Jolly Rancher I really like this subtle wash of color my lips feel very moisturized and like they'll be really protected from the dry weather it has the texture of aquaform it smells really good but it doesn't have a taste yeah I'm definitely going to keep this in my winter jacket so that my daughter and I can just use it every single day
