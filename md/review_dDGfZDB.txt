LynnRose reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: glossy stretch concealer is my favorite everyday concealer I love the packaging is so sleek and the Pink nude Vibes love it I don't really want to do my other eye so I'm not going to go but everywhere the concealer all day and it stinks sensitive skin so nicely I said it with the Wilder and I just love that it's very natural-looking it just helps with my dark under eyes and my no sleep because of my two kids I really do love how easy it is to apply everything would that brand is it was reused use your fingers to apply I'm all for a convenience and easy to apply product so that's why I think I really like it
