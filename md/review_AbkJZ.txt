valeriasernag reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so this is how the glossier lip gloss looks on top of a matte lipstick I'm wearing what I love about this product is that it's not that sticky like mostly buses like in my hair does is it actually doesn't stink on my lip said much does it supposed to reflect light more than most label says which I think it does it does the liver it's kind of pricey but I would totally get it again
