tayvescio reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys I wanted to review the glossier Cherry balm.com lip balm comes in the world's cutest Packaging it smells like cherries on Via screen but it's a bit more sweeter and more fruitier than natural Terry said I'm just going to apply some so I squeezed a little bit out onto my lips and then I do lend it in with my finger it does feel quite stick on your finger on your lips it doesn't feel very sick and it's very hydrating as well it provides you with this nice shade and I think it's really nice if you're just going out somewhere you don't want to put a lot of makeup on you to sweat a pop of color but it's also very buildable to so you can have just a little bit and have a bit of color or actually build it up I love all glassy-eyed products and if you've been thinking of getting this then I definitely recommend it
