fourteencarrot reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so my OG lengthening everyday mascara the glassy A Lash look so I will show you the difference this I have no mascara I do have other eye makeup on but you can see that my lashes do not show up at all but over here I have two layers of the glass A Lash slick so as you can see super lengthening to those lashes compared to this I super lengthening I love being able to get into the the bottom lashes and get every lash coatingand you know it isn't a volumizing but I don't know you tell me I think it I think it's perfect and it doesn't budge so it's not waterproof you take it off at a little bit of warm water you can almost just roll your eyelashes between your fingers but 10 of the 10 I really love this stuff I think it would be great for anybody
