thekristynedit reviews Generation G by Glossier: So This Is the glossier Gen G lipstick in the shade Leo as you can see it is very used and abused by yours truly I want to go ahead and buy it and show you guys what it looks like when you put it on so we do it so this is Leo it is a very warm tone kind of reddish brown it's like a perfect like 90s nude I love it it is such a beautiful color I find that the formula is not very long lasting but it is just a super comfortable formula and if you put like a lip gloss on top of it so pretty but let's build it up I want to show you what it looks like when you do that so this is what it looks like when you build it up it's extremely buildable but as you can see it's just a pretty like brown wash and color I really like these I think the price point is kind of high but I really like the color so if you want this type of color I would totally pick up Leo
