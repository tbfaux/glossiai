kilap reviews Glossier Cloud Paint A new way to blush (HAZE) by Glossier: this is cloud paint from glass can in the color caves I love this app like a kind of a raspberry color something I love about this is that a little goes a very long way and therefore it like last forever it's described on the bottle as a seamless tri-color that couldn't be more true cuz look at how easily it blends I guess I've been using this for years and I love it
