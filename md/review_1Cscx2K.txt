gabil reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: this is the glossier moisturizing Moon mask the package is very basic it's just a plastic tub with a glossy a moon mask sticker on top scary easy to unscrew and damask itself has a joey McGee texture I have a light set but I can't figure out what it smells like I have combination skin and I like using this once a week after a clay mask
