mimiwikiki reviews You, Perfume Solid by Glossier: this is the solid classy are you so I'm asking you because I'm obsessed with it after I have this full-on I took advantage of the Black Friday sale and I just want to work thinking about it I should have called me because I like it so much but instead I bought the solid as well as its refill the packaging is very interesting because of the giant rubber bands over the cardboard container but this is very nice cuz I know it didn't break but this is heavy heavy and so like you put your finger here and I think it just cuts wipe it down and boom bye Yae refill in this is the exact size it is very small compared to what I thought it was going to be a little bigger is a quarter it's like almost a little bit bigger than a quarter yeah it could be a quarter I think if they ever sell the liquid roll on again I would definitely buy the glass Au formula a solid is very very thick and it's kind of like a wax which is nice cuz it's all in there but it's hard to melt
