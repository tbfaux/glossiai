elenakrichbaum reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys it ain't nobody telling you all about the glossier Milky jelly concert so it says to massage cleanser on to dry or damp skin and runs through Lee and it is cruelty free and made in USA and I kind of really like this because like it's really good at removing all that dirt and oil but it's not like it's like anything like major improvements in my skin after using this is just the basic cleanser it's like I don't think there is any fragrance in itit doesn't look like there is but it does smell like aloe vera so I think it's going to be hydrated it's really hydrating so I really like this but it's not like a must have in my skincare routine I'd rather use the forms we mostly magic face wash and also for 8 Del Sol for the prices are better options
