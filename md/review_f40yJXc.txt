rianashahid reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: took my first video I wanted to review the glossy a perfecting skin tint and I wear this shade G6 which is a really good if I can be at your folks it's a really good like neutral medium deep shade so now put it on before picture but you can see that I have a lot of white spots and stuff and all this doesn't cover it up completely it does look a lot better so hold onto my skin looks really dewy and fresh and I love that about this
