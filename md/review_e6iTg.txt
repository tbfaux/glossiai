lonnekemckinney reviews Niteshine by Glossier: hello so today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy a play night shine in the shade platinum rose this is another one of my favorite highlighters this is just more of like a liquid or a cream highlighter usually I go for my haloscope which is a stick form and occasionally I go for the milk makeup stick highlighter it is definitely pre-planning if it doesn't look like a big cool are there we go. Alec and I wouldn't describe it as natural it says blend out very very well and it is nice if I know that I'm going to be out late at night maybe walking around out on the town on vacation
