Glamrie563 reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: guys I'm so excited this is the glossy a playground said I think it just came in my super great rewards a little while back and it finally came in and actually never use any glossier products before which is crazy I know but I don't know I guess they are the products or he's very natural-looking and I like kind of a more moderate to intense Glam and my looks but the Play Collection is supposed to be very glamorous very cool so let's see what's inside this thing I heard that like glossy product coming like this signature pink bag open box and inside we have this sample of the glossier Milky jelly cleanser very exciting and then it feels so quality and like I love the logo it's I'm excited
