chandlera98 reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: Tai Sao my bangs are a mess right now because I just got out of the shower because I was trying the body Hero by glossier Body hero oil so the first thing I want to say about this is that it smells so good seriously it is so good it's really great for shaving and it's an oil so it's moisturizing I noticed the smell doesn't last as long on the skin as I would like it too but other than that it's great and it smells so good that I don't care I will use it a lot
