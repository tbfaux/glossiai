krisballan reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier Milky jelly cleanser it's a conditioning face wash and I have my face wet right now and then I'm just going to go in with this guy who's going to do a puff on my tan so far it feels super hydrating it doesn't like lavender but it's kind of nice it feels like it won't wash away everything and leave my face feeling super super dry which I hate so so far so good right so I just washed it off my face feels super nice and smooth it was very moisturizing and that was good cuz my skin is super dry so I will get to keep you guys updated and then post another review later
