jules_r0se reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so this last one is the birthday cake Oregon it's just the birthday balm.com this is the packaging I really like the Halo it's a little bit and it almost to me is like teasing the boss of you play with a little more extra you know with the letter but I really like this one I really like the birthday cake flavor I find that birthday cake can kind of be overpowering sometimes a little too sweet but with this one it's just a little bit reminiscent of lip smackers and less it's like all up in your face but I really love this one the glitter doesn't like scratch my lips at all it's just as hydrating and I think it's like super cute to have that little pop of glitter
