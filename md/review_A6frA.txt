raggafragga reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: probably my last review for tonight is going to be the glossier zit stick along with many other things at the glossier pop-up in Seattle I got the zit stick not too long ago I have started just an Impulse buy because I'm not play Super prone to breakouts but hey it was cheap and I was having fun to pop up so anyways one of my favorite things about this is that it's super easy to take, to go I take it with me wherever I go for the most part every day when I go to work I bring it with me in my pocket along with a few other things because it's super easy to just take out of your pocket and pop on real quick when you notice to break out coming on now don't get me wrong it's definitely not an instant fix to any they serve break out so you make it but it's a super good way to minimize the appearance or irritation that any breakouts mail come along with overall I would recommend the product it's a fairly cheap for what it is is about 15 bucks I think and it's really good for sensitive skin so that's my review
