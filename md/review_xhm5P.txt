sweetlittleindulgences reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys so I wanted to mention glossier lash slick mascara I really been enjoying it and it's been lasting a really long time I've had it about three months already and it's still going pretty strong this is a great everyday mascara for a basic look it doesn't really deliver any crazy length or volume but my eyelashes are already pretty full so I don't need anything crazy I think that this deliver exactly what I need it last throughout the day it holds really wellmy eyelashes look nice and evenly spread out and long anytime I'm wearing this people always ask me if I'm wearing false eyelashes the packaging is super cute and I love using it definitely worth the money
