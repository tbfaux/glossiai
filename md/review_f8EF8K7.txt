dryskinreviews reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: I'm reviewing glossier boy brow in brown is Morgan on my browser right now this is about 3 or 4 hours of wear and it holds up pretty well as you can see my browser still kind of gelled up has a slight tint to it the brown I don't find it to be a really heavy which is a problem with some fragile that I've used as a little bit expensive for what it is I think I know there are a lot of drugstore dupes like Nick's which I haven't tried but NYX brow mascara is supposed to be good do and does the same thing soon do I like it yes am I going to her purchase it I think I'm going to try a drugstore dupe instead
