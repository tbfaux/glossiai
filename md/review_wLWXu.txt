harmonym reviews Colorslide by Glossier: okay I'm back part 2 so I got okay originally purchased pretty penny which is the color on the side and after using it and working with it a little bit I found the kind of not the biggest fan something that it's a pretty color but I feel like it's not as Capri as it should be in it kind of gives off little bit of kind of like a gross dirty monkey color because of the I don't know the payment it's weird it's kind of like a color changing pigment we're like right now it looks very pretty cousin up close to looks kind of dirty so I don't know if this was when I return a purchase first not the biggest fan of this one but then on this side we got nectar and guys I'm in love it's super trendy to have bright colors right now and I think of this really fits Trend and it does a good job of opening eyes so it's super pretty
