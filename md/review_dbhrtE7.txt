fourteencarrot reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: so back to glossier body hero so I use these right when they first came out I went through it I didn't repurchase it but on their Black Friday sale I re-upped and so I've been using them both this in the shower as it's there a daily oil wash I love this I think especially like days I just go to Pilates I'm just a little bit sweaty I think it's the perfect perfect for winter to cuz it's moisturizing while it's cleansing the smell is divine I just love the texture of this and then this is the daily perfecting cream I've been using this on my arms and legs when I get out of the shower it has a little bit at smione calm is a little bit of Shimmer in this that I don't want like when I'm about to put my pajamas on so that's my only qualm but if you're looking for like a good set lotion body wash I would consider this especially I think you could a deal when you buy them together on their website
