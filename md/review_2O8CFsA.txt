zameena reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: the sun is shining and it's time to put on my SPF I just reordered this glossier Invisible Shield SPF 35 and I know there's some thoughts going around about SPF 30 and how it's not enough but I like how this applies under my makeup this is a bottle it is one fluid ounce got this kind of pump to it and it go one pump looks like this there's two pumps and there's a third. Here's how it applies to the face as you can see it already just goes on rather clear and I make sure to massage it and it has a really bright smile to it smells like sunscreen if you don't like that smell then maybe this is not for you but look how nicely this goes on the face
