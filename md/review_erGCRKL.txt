kendrae reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: everyone's so getting the Christmas gifts I got this from my dad this is the glassy play vinylic clip I always thought it was a lip vinyl so I guess I've been calling it wrong this isn't shade of Genius I haven't watched here I really like how this one matches my lips like perfectly so it doesn't like change the color very much like at this little color are not wearing it right now just because I want to waste it things that I think is really nice is the applicator and the click up to get the product I think that's super cool and I just think it's more efficient way of doing it and so yeah I like absolutely love everything I've gotten from the play line from glossy I'm really into the eyeliners you can go watch those I have like multiple on them so yeah I just like this I like how hydrating it is and it lasts like I work for the night and it lasted all night so yeah I just enjoy this
