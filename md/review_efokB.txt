JayciNicole reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hi guys wanted to do a review today for you on glossier's stretch concealer so I have all my normal makeup on so I'm going to apply this for you under my eyes and they found a couple red spots I have so I just stuck my finger in it and then so I'm going to rub it or blend it I guess I'm with my beauty blender and just a little bit more by the way this shade is light I think it's the lightest when they have so right so it's done super easy to apply obviously it moves with your skin and it looks like skin and I have a little bit of creasing problems here but I just put powder on it and fix it right up so would definitely recommend this product
