fourteencarrot reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so today I'm going to review one of my favorite brow products like glossier boy brow so I am a redhead I really like the shade of blond that matches my natural hair a little bit better than the brown does so I'm just going to take the blonde brush it's a small little brush that allows you to code every little hair I use this to not only tint my brows and fluff them up but it also helps them keep in place throughout the day so I have longer pretty full natural brows so I need help keeping them in place or I'll go and check the mirror and they'll be all wonky you can see this is with boy brow and this is without so it does a good job of fluffing them up while tinting them and keeping them in place
