DestinyD reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: let's talk about the gloss and lip gloss I love this one I fell in love with as soon as I put on I'm it's just simple beautiful lip gloss what I love about it is the applicator because you don't have to keep dipping into the lip gloss you get more product and literally all it takes is one stripe on the bottom lip and then flip it around and then swipe on the top lip and you have a beautiful glossy look and I think it's totally worth the price so if you're looking into this thing definitely I will.
