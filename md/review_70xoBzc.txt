lilyytay reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: is this bubble wrap from glossy which is their eye and lip Plumping cream and it's been my go-to everyday eye cream for the morning I was initially interested in this because I love a good multi-use product and it really does work really great on both the eyes and lips it's a very simple product and does exactly what it says which is plump and hydrate which I actually really enjoy I do have dark circles under my eyes but I just use a brightening eye cream at night and use this in the morning
