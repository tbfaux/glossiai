hannahbeauty reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I'm continuing to review some of my favorite glossier products and this is glossier birthday balm.com and I have a brand new one and a pretty old one right here to compare and as you can see the packaging well it's stunning at first it really starts to lie completely flake off as you use the product which is my biggest issue with this product because it gets all over my hands and my fingers but at the same time I still think that farm., is worth it I put a little bit right here and you can kind of see it has this pretty glittery Sheen to it I'm wearing bomb.com on my lips right now and it's the scent and like the flavor is incredible it's smelled all of the bomb that calms and this one is by far the best it's like the sweet vanilla and I love it because you can put it on your cuticles to it really is a universal bomb I'm so I think it's a great product I just wish they changed the package
