abooogie_ reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: I picked up the one of the new lip glosses from Kelsey this is a metallic one so consistency is the same as the original I love it you know it's not sticky it isn't super long wearing but that's okay it's the glass you can reapply it but I do love it so much and I love you can tell it's honestly gorgeous when you put it on it's not subtle but it's also not like in your face and it's honestly really cute
