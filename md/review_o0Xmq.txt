earthismyheaven reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so I have three of the dossier lidstar colors and this one is in Cub Tijeras the swash and this is what it looks like when flash on okay so then I'm going to put this on again and then I'm going to blend it out for you guys so you can see the difference so that's what it looks like when you kind of wanted it with your finger so if you want to use it more as a shadow then you should I recommend to blend it out but if you want to use it as a liner then you just Lair it and don't smudge it at all
