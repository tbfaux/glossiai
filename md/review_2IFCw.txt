TheDanaRipperton reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hi guys so this is the glossier stretch concealer and I have it in a G9 I love the stuff I've never tried it and I bought it recently and the reason I love it so much is if you have issues with concealers kind of making your own your eyes look greasy and older and kind of creepy looking this stuff is like Moisturizer in a bottle in a jar I guess and it really covers like you can see me covering everything but it doesn't leave it so that you can see more wrinkles and lines and look at this when it cover the sit with it right now and it looks like skin love it
