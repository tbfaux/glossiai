lonnekemckinney reviews Haloscope by Glossier: hello so today I'm going to be a telescope in the shade chords I really like this I'm not currently wearing it but it is definitely one of my favorite highlighters I use this almost everyday I kind of rotate with this one and the milk makeup highlighter I also really like that one too when I want more of a bright blinding highlight but I love this for more natural days it just gives a very Dewey shine I don't know if it'll show up but here it is on the back of my hand and I put it right there I don't know if it's showing up but I really like this I couldn't decide between quartz and Moonstone when I was purchasing this and I guess I'm happy I chose quartz cuz I do really like it but I'm also planning on purchasing and stone as well cuz I think moonstone is also a very pretty shade
