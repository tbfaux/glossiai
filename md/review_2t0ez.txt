nikkimalia reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: glossier's lash slick mascara so it is now 4 in the afternoon and I applied it may be around 9 a.m. today it didn't hold the curl but I do like the light weight formula and how it doesn't smudge because usually when I put mascara on my bottom lashes it just makes me look like a raccoon I also really love this applicator it does not cut my lashes together and it adds length over volume on my lashes I don't know I like it but I'm still kind of on the fence I'm going to have to try this a couple more times because it didn't really do anything significant to my eyelashes but yeah I'm going to give it a couple more runs
