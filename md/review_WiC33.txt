Brittany_Michelle reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: everybody let me turn my lights back up I just wanted you to be able to see the bottle but it's just glossier lip balm and let me turn up my lights are there it goes so you can see me better okay so basically this is a universal skin Salve is what it claims to be actually got this in Ypsi and I do like it it doesn't have a taste or anything like that but I kind of I don't really enjoy I have to squeeze it out and then put it on your lips I like more of like a ChapStick form but also this is it just a ChapStick so I can understand why they put it in this kind of bottle on this little tube and so it is very helpful I you can put around your cuticles if they get dry and if so many uses so I do enjoy this I just don't use it as much anymore but I really need to because my cuticles are looking a little rough but anyways yeah this stuff is super good and I check it out of her
