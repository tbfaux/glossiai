sarah_novio reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so for the last couple months have been trying to find glass a deuce and I found one for the boss a cloud paint and this is the undone Beauty lip2cheek valid so I have the shade Rosewood so it's like an orange Rosy tone and a base illegals from White medians opaque and I didn't know the head of verse When I bought this but I like to smell them all together and just started on my cheeks and all my nose and it gets a really nice pigmentation and it leaves a glow on the cheese just like the cloud paint does and it's super beautiful
