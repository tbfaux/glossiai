paugzzf reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so I have to say that this Cloud paint in shape beam that's actually a really nice plush I tried to use this once and it was definitely not a good idea well it's not specified that you can use it for your lips but I wanted to try it comes in a liquidity presentation in the only thing is that he's actually very natural and that the caller it's very sheer sometime so you need to like react Isom. So these are how old drops are whatever you want to call them so that the Shaded suck East actually Mornington but other than that I really like these
