yolk reviews Deodorant by Glossier: okay I did the video on this like literally yesterday but I might delete that one because my lip is very swollen than that and so no one needs to see that but anyways is stage 2 of using the CO2 right and I just wanted to give a little update and I can only say if it like helps with us whether or not cuz I don't usually sweat as much but I feel like I just put this on for fun because it makes my pet smell really good but so far it does not make my pits itchy that's a good sign and it goes hand-in-hand with my orange blossom perfume that I recently just got but is it worth it for $22 or $18 whatever it is no this is a little bit expensive for a deodorant that's kind of buying into the branch and it's cute and it's nice so treat yourself
