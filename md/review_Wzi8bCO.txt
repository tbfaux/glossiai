tangomango reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so this is the next review which is going to be ugly glossier birthday balm.com this one does not have a tent but it has little sparkles in it so it's like a really really natural one but it also has like a little bit like jazz. Cuz of the Sparkles I'm just not a fan of the scent I don't really know why I guess it's like it's so faint but then at the same time it's take too much I guess I just don't think this was a good scent it doesn't really smell like it kind of smells like birthday cake and icing but not really like I'm very confused by the smell of this one and also the label didn't print all the way online but that's just random but I don't think I would really recommend this one like maybe for the tent only better for the 10th but if you're looking for just a smell I would not recommend this one
