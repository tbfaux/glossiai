hadleyyaya reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to be talking about the glossier cloud paint in shade beam as you can see I really love this product my tube is kind of 30 and abused but yeah I really love this product I think that it's such an amazing blush and its really buildable so when I apply this product I just take a little bit on my finger and I tap it out from my cheeks to my temples and I just sent it out with my fingers I know some people you like to use Beauty blenders are like makeup sponges but I like to use my fingers and it just leaves you looking really Sunkist and pretty and very natural which is why I love it oh yeah I definitely recommend this product it's amazing
