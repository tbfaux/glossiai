naomiepp reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: glossier Cloud paint in beam okay so this is One Cheek with a little. Like I cannot express how tiny of an amount of cloud paint is on this cheek but look at the difference so I'm going to show you how I apply Cloud paint I'm wearing no makeup by Justin my skin care to my skin is very Dewey but I'm wearing no other makeup and that's how I like to wear this shade in particular okay for open it up and I'm not going to school at all actually there's like a tiny bit of residue and I'm going to dab it on my cheek like that and then right away before it dries since it is a little bit tacky because it's like residual product from using it before it's going to drive faster than usual and this formula when it dries at least for me it doesn't budge so I just kind of doing that keep blending and it really does help if your skin is kind of dewy to begin with
