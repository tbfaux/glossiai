nikitanikitanikita reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: Hi-5 the mega greens Galaxy pack with me and I love this mud mask almost completely done with it cuz I use it so it is a little bit like harsh as online masks are so if you have dry skin I wouldn't like dry and sensitive skin I want to recommend it but it is really nice and it does leave my skin like super Chloe and I don't like beautiful looking I do have to moisturize after using it though so that's the one thing but yeah I totally recommend this product and its really great
