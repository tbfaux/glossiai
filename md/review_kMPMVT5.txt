macyrcrawford reviews Glossier Stretch Concealer 0.17 oz / 5 ml (Light) by Glossier: hi everyone so I'm going to share with you one of my favorite product to use when I'm doing like my actual 5 minute makeup routine where like it's literally this like maybe if you didn't know what actually looks like to think I would have makeup on but I do so at this is the glossier's stretch concealer I have to shade G11 and it just comes in a pot I put my finger in it and then top it only works great and it's not like full coverage at all but I found those cover like the darkness under my eyes, even thought my skin tone doesn't totally cover my blemishes but that's okay with me I do like to set it with powder as well but it doesn't Kris too bad because it is like a minimal product so I would definitely recommend for a 5 minute makeup look if you're looking for something like that
