mollymoro reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to be reviewing me Lassie a cloud paint and bean my opinions on it this is my everyday go to flush if I'm not wearing powder or anything and I just want to look natural and glowy so if that's the look that you like this is perfect for you so you don't need a lot of this product to have a choice about that much which isn't that much for both of my cheeks should I start right in the middle and then I just blend it out Prejudice on both sides obviously I also like to put a little bit my nose which is a life hack if you want to look cute I don't know I don't know anything about looking cute okay and don't come for me so it dries down to just feel like a powder feels like you're not wearing anything on your skin which is really nice
