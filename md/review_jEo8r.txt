StephanieC reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: girl have glossy lipstick with me right now I really like it I think it looks very natural compared to some of the other mascara it really lengthen and looks almost like lash extensions and I think it's really easy to wear last for a long time and let me show you a close-up so this is a close up I can show you the brush looks like I think the applicator is actually really nice see here look for that and it's like flexible to can see how Benz I think it works really well and last all day for me then you just wash it off with some warm water
