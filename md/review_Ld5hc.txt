oliviahickly reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: look at me being very sick I'll look what I'm back with just like the most interesting product they have in my opinion Cloud paint my favorite glossy a product on the face of the planet I used to hate blush because it just looks so chunky and gross and unnatural and then color paint came into my life from his car paint so I'll just take I have four but I usually use beam and Hayes so I'll just mix them together in equal parts and blend it out with my fingers and they blend really easily and are Supernatural and they stay on all day and I just love how they look and the Duo's 30s so by the duo cuz that's great
