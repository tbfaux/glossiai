MyBeautyThesis reviews Generation G by Glossier: this is the glossier generation G lipstick in the color zip which is a beautiful orange toned red and I'll show you how that looks so I love the Genji lipsticks because they have a really nice soft matte powder affect then their mental look bloated so they really give that cuz I'm done effortless look and I call this one of my daytime red because you don't have to fuss with that you don't have to worry about lip liner touching up all the time and it really doesn't look like you tried too hard you just kind of threw it on and went out the door and I also love that it smells like roses it's really really nice so I am a glossy affiliate if you want to save 10% off your order just shot through the link in my bio
