Beautaf reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey guys I'm review stretch concealer again because I discovered a new way to apply it this is the most Flawless application of found yet I've tried it with my finger with a brush and now I'm trying I did it with a beauty blender and I kid you not it like looks like I have nothing on it is so flawless so Flawless it really looks like your skin there's your streaks and this is the only way I've gotten my stretch concealer to last the longest without creasing I find that increases a bit with it when I fight with a brush or if my finger this just does not crease let me apply it and show you what it looks like after this is what it looks like applied it is Flawless pinch your sponge dip it into your concealer and then stamp it on under your eyes it's perfect
