weird_bronwyn reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to be reviewing the glossier cloud paint which is there Cream Blush if you are a lover of Cream Blush this will be one of your new favorite product the best thing to give him out of this product is that a law goes a long way in which I'm about to demonstrate as I show you the swatches of the colors that I have in my collection these are just by applying a drop in the allowing it to blend like I said they're very very pigmented so this is haze this is storm and this is Puff actually have Puffs on my cheeks at the moment as you can see once you blend it out into the skin it really isn't that in times but like I said a little goes a long way so be careful with how much you apply especially when using darker colors like a sandstorm so yeah
