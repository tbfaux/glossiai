ashlyn reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys this is my first review ever and I'm going to be reviewing the glossier balm.com so this is what the packaging look like in this is Domingo on its supposed to smell like mango and it definitely does smell like mango or Hi-Chew mango if you ever smoked pot before it's also supposed to be tinted pink and it honestly is so we're not light is on so it also gives you a little bit of gloss and if you don't use as much as me and honestly just works as a regular chapstick also there are also different one this one's The Mint one and this is the coconut one this is the coconut one looks like it's I think they're so cute and also these ones are colorless so if you're looking for something without color you can try the coconut or men or even the original one
