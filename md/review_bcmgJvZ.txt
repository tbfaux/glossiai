kimberlygisele reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: all right so next up on my declutter list are the owner comes by glossy pencil the same flavor which is the Cherry this is actually my first ever bomb.com not this one but like the flavor maybe four years ago these one of them was mine with them was my sister's I gifted her when she never used to I took a bath I didn't end up using it much and the next day or that I'm decluttering is MIT this was a staple I mostly got a custom packaging very cute again I feel like coffee does packaging really well that's what appeals to the consumers but as for effective is this wasn't that we sure I saying it's the Penguins or the Cherry ones did leave a nice pink tint to have a pre artificial smell of soap for the Mint one I am trying to stray away from like peppermint tea stuff on my lips it just makes for some reason and I do have a fourth one of these but I'm actually using that one up with their limited edition stakebob.com that would smells like strawberries and has a really pretty cool.
