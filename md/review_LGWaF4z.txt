sisterzoe reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello everyone I am so excited because Michael Altier came yes it did it came with this cute little pink bag in the sticker and I got some really great stuff and I'm going to be trying it out so for someone to talk to you all about the cloud paints I got the mail slot desk the first one going to talk a little bit about is dusk so I really didn't take too much I just little bit out of my hands and I'll just dab it on the my cheek and it's really nice and blendable yes they are you're so pretty I think they last a really long time I think the pigmentation is shouldn't gorgeous I think the color range is also really nice I have paler skin I think that desk actually looks really nice on it I think you're definitely worth the hype five out of five hundred percent go get you some
