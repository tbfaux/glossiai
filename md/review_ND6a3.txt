fourteencarrot reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: this is the glossy a bubble wrap I in a lip Plumping cream I love this I just got it yesterday this is totally a first impressions review I think I'll post another one maybe in a couple weeks with no makeup on and show you how I use it but so this is almost announce which I'm okay with because it does have a six-month shelf life so I want to make sure wish it was something like I cream I don't want it in too big of a container cuz I want to make sure I use it all before it expires and it comes with this little pump you can see how to pump a little bit for you poops so it's hygienic which I really like when you dip a finger into a pot of eye cream it just gives you more chances to get germs in your eyes girls so I used it last night I'm obsessed with it I love it I think it feels really cooling so if you're looking for an eye cream I would definitely get this one
