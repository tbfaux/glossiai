nevibaby reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: this is Degrassi a quitter July in the shade firewalk and me being an Aries obsessed with the shade so my birthday is actually tomorrow April 5th but I celebrated it last night and I'm going to show you all the look that I did with the glitter July so I left my makeup look pretty basic you know I added a little bit more highlighter and probably a bit more blush but then I did just a little inner corner highlight and I basically coated my entire eyelid with the fire walk I take some on the applicator brush it on like this also like to gently place it under my eye to make it just super extra thank you a thousand times super great it is Navi approved
