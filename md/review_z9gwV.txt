earthismyheaven reviews Generation G by Glossier: so I'm going to let that lip balm sink in for a minute before I put my glossy a generation G lipstick on I have the shape and Cake which is actually on a leave right now so I thought I would show everybody but it looks like so here is the color from the two and it's just a really pretty product so this product is meant to be layered if you want us to settle look just put a little bit on like this if you want it to be darker just continue doing swatches until it's the Shady like so I personally really like cake for my skin tone I think it's similar to Leo but it's a little bit more for the lighter skin tones
