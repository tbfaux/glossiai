Elizaepp reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: hello through the day I wanted to do an update review on this class v a invisible shield daily sunscreen okay so this stuff is SPF 35 and use it every single day in the morning so I'll just play with that much my hand a little bit goes a long way and then put it all over my face okay so I just applied it as you can see it leaves a little bit of a glow in your face which is really nice so usually I'll just wear this and then put argan oil or moisturizer over it sometimes I will just wear this as a moisturizer so I really recommend this if those were great on the skin and protects it as well
