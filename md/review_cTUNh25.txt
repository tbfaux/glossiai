butterandbeauty reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: okay so I did a second part on this just because it wasn't long enough to talk the reason I like this so much if you have to watch the first video first obviously is that it's not very thick it is buildable mistake I mean like dense so I like it it's like if you're looking for something that gives a lot of like coverage that's not it but that's what I love about this you can actually even if you've seen a makeup artist Judy Katie Jane Hughes she uses as a foundation by like buffing it out and I just like it because it just looks like my skin you can still see like my freckles I just feel like I don't like heavy makeup is also doesn't crease it's like it's really amazing under the eyes and I found for me when I do get like acting I don't break out much so if you're someone that is trying to lighten scars are spots I'm not going to pretend that I know what that's like that's not really my forte but it does work don't ignore my run is right here yeah that's why I love this
