harmonym reviews Glossier Perfecting Skin Tint G5 is a warm deep shade 1 fl oz / 30 ml by Glossier: I don't understand how it's literally been like months since I've used super great and the product search thing is still fucked up this is glossy solar pain I have tested it out again this is a little trial and I would have to say that I wasn't good enough that I wanted to purchase Ed while I didn't find that it was like to Metallica necessarily I just don't think that it really was something that I need in my collection it wasn't quite pigmented enough and I didn't feel like the shades really worked for my skin very wellit was nice I mean I think it's good for like a subtle bronzing moment or maybe if you kind of want something that's giving you an all-in-one kind of bronze blush highlighter type moment but I just I don't know it wasn't really working amazing for me and I didn't really love it and also the shade range just is not very suitable for very many skin tones like I could run up to this shade so
