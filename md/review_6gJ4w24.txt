linanguyennn reviews Glossier You Perfume Solid fragrance compact and Glossier You eau de parfum by Glossier: so today I'm going to be reviewing because you you it's probably one of my favorite princess right now I've been using it every single day and it's actually really cool because it's different for everybody and it changes depending on your pH bubble and the cool thing about mine is that they actually gave me a scarf with my purchase and it was only around like $60 including tax and I didn't have to pay shipping and handling because I actually bought it at their Dallas Papa and yeah I think it's a great product and I would totally recommend it
