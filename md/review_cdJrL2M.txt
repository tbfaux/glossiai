legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Futuredew by Glossier: is Burger is a talking about the sample of glasses future due again so I think now that I've used it a second time and can confirm that it definitely does pill when I put on my phone dacian so I'm just I'm generally just kind of disappointed with this when this first came out I was so excited I love glowing products and just a concept of it is so beautiful in every single way including packaging so I wanted to love this so much but it just doesn't work like it it works fine if you don't put on anything else on top of it but as soon as you put on Foundation like for me it just killed so much that I like I just I can't like I might just use the rest of this one a day where i'm not actually going to put on Foundation before me that's most days which renders this product that I would never actually buy it fortunately if it did work I think I would like it a lot more cuz it does seem to be quite Chloe so I do like that it's just the pilling is insane for me
