legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: pics of grapes are used up my sample of cloud paint in the shade dusk today and I'm just really really in love with this Jay deibel I've been in love with pretty much every shade of use from them but this one is a super super nice neutral look that I think it was really well with you know when you're trying a more crazy eyeshadow look or just you know a color that wouldn't go as well with pink blush like blue so sure is what's left on it you can see it's a very very neutral color has a slight orange undertone to it that I really like I just think this is a really unique blush color that goes Super well with any in a bright lipsticks bright eyeshadow so yeah this is probably going to be the next bus say that I buy because yes is it's so easy it goes so well with everything
