mariahrnorth reviews Generation G by Glossier: I'm really excited about this review this is the generation G lipstick from glassy eye and cake I got it for Christmas and I love the color I will show you what it looks like she can see my lips look pretty dead and lifeless what I like about this is that the colors not too heavy and it's almost like chapstick it's amazing that's cake I like it it's a good color without being too much sometimes I'll take a little bit off to make it more on G but I wear this pretty much every day for my go-to I would highly recommend
