lilyytay reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: I just got the new glossy lip glosses in the mail so now I have the original holographic and red shades I thought I would do a little Tryon of all of them I do think these are some of the glossiest lip glosses I've tried although they are pretty sticky this is the original clearshade I did notice that this has a scent where is the new shades do not but actually really like the scent of this this is D holographic shade which has glitter with gold green and pink reflex it's pretty subtle but I really like it this is the red shade and it has a very subtle Red Tent which I'm really happy with I definitely think it's my favorite out of the three
