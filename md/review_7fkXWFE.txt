butterandbeauty reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys so I am going to be reviewing these glossier lidstar this is the purple color and Lily I mean I'm going to put it on it's not that easy to do on camera on my eyes so let us watch it for you and then I'll show you like what when I looks like with one layer and then two layers and hopefully that's helpful so sucks watching my hand and I'm going to show you the rest okay so first off I really like the dough to the applicator and also doesn't take too much product that you could tell us a bit more but I like to do sorry and I like that and then I'm going to layer it again okay so this is two layers this is like one and a half hours they pass up the other one but as you can see it you can definitely build it to be a lot more but I like that and I think it's a great product
