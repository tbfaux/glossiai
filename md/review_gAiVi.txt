kelseylynne reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: so this is the glossier moisturizing Moon mask and I wanted to start off by saying how cute the packaging is glassy-eyed does it again of course so I've had this product for some time now and it really does wonders for my skin the directions say to apply a thick layer to moist skin allow it to soak in for 20 minutes avoiding your eye area and then to rinse well but I personally love about this mask is that it's not super heavy on the skin it does go on white but you know that it's doing its job when it starts to soak and become clear after rinsing it off as well my skin feels baby soft so I would definitely recommend this product for someone that needs a really moisturizing mask treatment
