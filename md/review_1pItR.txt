alexarae reviews Solution by Glossier: sosebee glasses solution exfoliating skin perfector it's an exfoliating acid with aha BHA and PHA acids in it so I just washed my face and then I'll take this class c a cotton pad I do to pump then I just press it all over my skin all over my face sure to get all the area after I'm done putting it all over my face and I just leave my skin a little bit red but it fades pretty quickly and say Jesus in the morning I'll make sure to follow up with a sunscreen as with any acid I put on your face just make sure to use sunscreen and I've been using this for a couple months now it's just really helped with some of my breakouts and helps keep my pores clean and makes my face really soft as I'll definitely be continuing to use it before it
