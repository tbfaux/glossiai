discobeautie reviews Solution by Glossier: okay I love grown cereal. Huge stands I bought this recently I really only have acne like hormonal acne I don't have like really constant bad acne so I feel like this was made for me which is why I don't love it cuz it's 6 I like acid if that's a little Clique acid and so that's like more for like acne-prone skin so I feel like it just like dry my skin out so I don't know if it's not really a product for me I prefer the Pixi glow tonic which is more of like a neutral acid feel like everyone's skin so but if you have like really bad acne and might be helpful for like clearing breakouts yeah I just wasn't a huge fan
