lonnekemckinney reviews Generation G by Glossier: hello so today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier Gen G lipstick in the shade zip so this is my second shade I have of this lipstick I also have these shaped like and I really enjoy this shade it looks like a very vibrant red and it can definitely build to that point but I prefer just one or two swipes across the lips I prefer to just like this just a slight wash of color of the lips but if you want it to get to that very bold red you can definitely do that with this what I've noticed is my shade like is definitely harder to build up to its full potential but this build up very quickly
