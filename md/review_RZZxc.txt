reflektor reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys sorry if I look terrible i've been crying a lot because my dog just died so I'm really sad right now but I did just come home and I got my first ever glossy a package I got does it stick the boy brow and three bomb.com so I'm just going to try out one of these and see what's up the amount of packaging of the season is a little excessive so I may be the only person in this world who does not have this product all right but it smells really good good squeeze get it out but this is what it looks like it's like a light pink so this actually reminds me a lot of the Smiths Rose South and I think that's honestly a little cheaper this is nice I think it's a little expensive for what it is I'll check out the other two that I got as well and let you know how those ones are though
