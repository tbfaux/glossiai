AnneBijo reviews Wowder by Glossier: it's a great tool Dusty glossier wowder so this is how it looks it's really pretty and it's really big and gray aesthetic I highly recommend this product of those who want to use it as a setting powder while to really like this because it blurs the appearance of pores and set the makeup very well and it also like cuts off the shine and Shimmer on your face if you and him have a really do we Foundation it like kind of cuts the shine out so this is how the inside looks like all you have to do is get your brush just a bit and you don't need that much cuz it's the same Potter but yeah I really like it and I highly recommend it
