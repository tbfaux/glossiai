missylissy reviews Haloscope by Glossier: hi guys so yes I do have oily skin so I do create my own blow but sometimes I like to add some more and that's why I'm excited to try the glossy a Halo scope in the shade chords so this is the Shady described as the most universal it's like in between the other two shades chords and it's really pretty it's kind of like a champagne color and in the middle you can see it has I guess like a moisturizer sick in the middle and then the outside ring is the Shimmer so I'm hoping I can just like. This on top of my foundation and it won't mess it up so let's see so it didn't mess up the foundation and actually pretty applied pretty well and now I'm just blending out with the beauty bronzer I do like how it looks it's pretty natural or just add the glow and I think I'm going to keep using it and yeah I'm really happy
