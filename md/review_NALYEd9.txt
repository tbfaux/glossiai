zameena reviews Skywash by Glossier: hey everyone I've got these two glassy Sky washes in the shade lawn and pool and I want to share what these look like SWAT stand on my eyelids so that's what the colors look like with one swipe it's not really recommended that you build it up because it does doesn't build up super amazing but it looks like it's got a really powdery consistency once you kind of buff it out I'm going to get it on my eyes now figured what it looks like with pool on my LEDs then here's lawn just as a little pop of color so it's it's really basic but it's really pretty if you just want a really simple color on your Lids without too much effort nothing super glitter Lee glitter
