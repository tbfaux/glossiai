heatherlane reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: I'm super crank I finally got my eyebrow I already used it today but here is the applicator I'm loving it I think it has a really nice almost to the eyebrow while being like a nice color and it's tinted which is great faces benefit but I wasn't liking it so much I was like let's make a switch and I'm really glad I did because this is a fantastic product I think you should all get it
