allthatskincaress reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: now this is my favorite mascara for I mean not a whole lot of reasons I just have a lot of memories attached to this mascara I love glossy this is one of the first product that he bought from glassy a it's like a special tubing mascara it looks like this depression of silicone so very different from other mascaras like the climax one that I just reviewed it absolutely does not smudge because of the tubing technology and it's also really really easy to take off because of the tubing technology I definitely am going to repurchase this one of the few mascaras that I actually will repurchase just because I mean it's beautiful it works and I have so many memories attached to it I can't not rebuy it so yeah mascara ever
