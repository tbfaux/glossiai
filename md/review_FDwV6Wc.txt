christyc reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: this is the glossier Mega greens Galaxy Pack products and I know there's a lot of reviews for them so I thought I would try and do a first impression of this mask I just opened it up and this is what it looks like, like putting clay hybrid and smells a little weird but it's not very strong smelling so it has to apply thick layer to moist skin and allowed to drive for 20 minutes so I can go get my Facebook so I just rinse my face off after about 20 minutes and I don't notice a huge difference after one use but I do like that it didn't dry my skin out a ton my skin feels really soft and I look forward to using again
