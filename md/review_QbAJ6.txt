butterandbeauty reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: this is the glass in a bubble wrap I am lip Plumping cream this I really like it it's $26 but it's also if you only want a little bit like during the day it was really well under makeup I do like it on my lips as well but it's I don't I like to like layer it under a lip balm or under bomb.com or something like that but it's a good multi-use product and the pump is our defense is a good round at once and travel friendly so overall I really like this I bought this and I would repurchase it definitely because it's such a kind of like good just in general simple eye cream
