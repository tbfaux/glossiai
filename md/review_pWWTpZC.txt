tangomango reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: your sister just going to be air view of The Kolache a pro tip black liquid eyeliner this is what it looks like I'll see what the temp look like but I did get this for free so I don't know how much it was just cuz the Colosseum last night like I ordered a huge order off of glossy and I lost it so they gave me everything for free but I just want I just watch. Mahan the person that did this video so that's what it looks like it barely smudges but that's cuz I was like the one I got so I know but it's still stays pretty good I don't wear eyeliner in lust so I don't really like care if it's like going to stay for the whole day or whatever like if you really want something that's going to stay for like a really long time that I probably wouldn't recommend it because like I literally just switched and it's already the coming off of it so but I don't really need to bring a super long-lasting so I like this one but yeah
