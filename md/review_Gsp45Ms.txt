fourteencarrot reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: I'm finally tossing this glassy a perfecting skin tint this is still the light so this is before they upgraded to their new shades it's about 1/4 left this is a really light light coverage to the point where I don't even know if it's worth putting on so I don't fully understand what this product does I have another one in their new shade range that I might use I don't know I just this doesn't appeal to me really anymore especially when I can just swipe on a concealer and just kind of tap where I need it instead of putting on the super light coverage so I don't think this is a product I will repurchase probably ever
