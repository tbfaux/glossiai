jenica reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: everyone so today I'm going to review the glossier Lash slick so this mascara is actually inspired by Japanese mascara is making it humidity proof and sweat resistant but it can easily wash off with warm water and it has tiny little fibers that give you a natural extension look I'm going to do a quick demo on this guy and compare it to my natural lashes this is what the brush looks like so this is what it looks like from the far is what it looks like up close these are my natural lashes this the best mascara ever used it actually stays on when I cry so if that doesn't make you want to buy it then I don't know what we'll just kidding but not really but you should try this it's amazing it's only $16 and I have a 10% off code I'll put in the description
