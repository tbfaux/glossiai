glowquest_ reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: mrs. glass years bomb.com which this is the coconut flavor I do have other flavors birthday cake and the rose one I think I do like it I mean the packaging is super cute and I think that's really what gets people because honestly I just don't know if it's worth $12 as opposed to like a regular Blistex or me no chapstick brand that you can get at the drugstore for a couple bucks I'll show you the consistencyI mean it's pretty much like a Vaseline almost type consistency it smells good I mean it works it keeps my lips smooth but I just don't know if I'm going to continue to spend $12 on it
