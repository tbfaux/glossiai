lilyytay reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: this is glossier's newest bomb.com and it does the berry sent I've been super obsessed with this coconut is usually my number one but this is a very close second for me it smells a little bit more like grape than Barry to me but it smells very nostalgic and like a candy I used to eat in my childhood so I've been wearing it Non-Stop this is what it looks like on my lips it has the prettiest fairy shade tint to it and I've been loving it so much for fall and we'll definitely be wearing it in the winter as well I think if you're someone who loves a tinted lip balm you really can't go wrong with this
