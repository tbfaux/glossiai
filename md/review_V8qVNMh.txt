kathryng reviews Haloscope by Glossier: he's super great next I'm going to be reviewing the glossy a Halo scope in shade ports I love the Tyler I'm wearing it now I've been wearing all day and you can still see a little bit of this Shimmer which is really nice I've really oily skin so this literally just Glides on my skin and then I've had it with my fingers so my favorite places to put it are my nose and now you can see it's right there very powerfully but then I just landed in and it looks like a gloss on my skin and then I had to put it on my cheeks and not going to do that now cuz I kind of like what is just on my nose I just put the Swatch on my hand as soon as I put a lot of layers I'll show you guys the SWAT there it is it's really like that was like rubbing it back and forth 10 times so it's pretty sure it is perfect for an everyday look and that is what I use it for everyday
