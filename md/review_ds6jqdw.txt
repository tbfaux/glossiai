Airee21 reviews Glossier Cloud Paint Duo Storm and Dawn 0.33 fl oz Pack of 2 by Glossier: all right next to y'all you're going to want to neutralize the brows and you don't typically like you're only going to have to worry about it if you have dark eyebrows like me if you have blond eyebrows you're pretty much good to go so she told me that you could use either a lipstick or an eyeshadow on the tutorial but I decided to go with my glossy a and the color Dawn because I knew is very Orange in a few minutes I was very nervous because it's a cream but it actually did work out on the reason I was nervous is because you do put a concealer over-the-top after you neutralize your brows so what I did is I got a fluffy brush just went over the browand then we'll off let that sink in right through the other girl will and then come back do your first layer of concealer and I'll show you guys what I use for concealer
