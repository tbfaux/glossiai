amandalynch reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey so I'm just going to do a quick review on glossier lash slick the lighting in my room is a little bit bad but I did about two coats with the Lash like at 2 today now 9 so I've worn it for about 7 hours I don't have any of those black flakes or anything around my eyes like you do get with like some other mascaras and then I like when my lash like a little dried out so I just started a new bottle about 2 weeks ago so I'm just kind of getting back to that point we're not a ton of it comes out of the the bottle onto the wand that's what I like it the best I think it's a little bit more natural but overall for an everyday mascara I would definitely recommend it
