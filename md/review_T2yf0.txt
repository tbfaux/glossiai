tru_beauty reviews Colorslide by Glossier: what up yet another drunk review so this is glossy plays color slide it's just like a pencil liner and I had my doubts with a lot of glossy a plays products cuz it just looks like it's just go see a on steroids but I was very curious about this product because I've never really messed around like colored eyeliner before now that I have it on I'm like surprisingly digging it you got to be careful with it because when I first like you used it the tip that was already kind of like the fault in the package broke off but like once you start sharpening it and like kind of getting used to it it Smooths out on its own after like this color really stays like surprisingly so I was out in the rain and I needed to rub my eye and none of it's smudged
