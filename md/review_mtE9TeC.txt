lifewcourt reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: glossier boy brow I have this in the shade blond I will touch on the shade rage saying that I wish there was more shades because the blonde is a little dark for me still even I do love the applicator of this product I feel like it holds a lot of product but it's small enough for your brows this is what I mean I feel like a little dark on me so I normally is going with a spoolie next to like even in Odin make it lighter overall I do really love this product for that natural fluffy bra look
