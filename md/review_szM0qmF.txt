helenemmert reviews Futuredew by Glossier: so this is the glossy a future do and it comes in this really pretty bottle I love the packaging and this Serum is basically an oil serum so it's really good for dry skin but not really for oily skin and I love the applicator everything about this is so cute so you don't really mean to use a lot you only need like one pump for the entire face and this is what it looks like it has like a small sent to it has a ginger sent which is really good and this is what it looks like on my hair and it's really natural dewy looking
