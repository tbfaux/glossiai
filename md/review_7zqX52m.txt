alaiyabijou reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: hi guys should I just saw my favorite moisturizer was the first aid Beauty moisturizer on my skin if I'm going to wear a lot of makeup that day so it's like I'm going out to dinner or I'm going to party with not going to happen for a long time or if I'm like have to do something important I'll usually use this moisturizer it's the glossier priming moisturizer what I like about this is that you don't have to use a primer or moisturizer cuz it's two in one and it really works you use like a glob like this and it's enough for your whole face its then it's kind of watery but not really but it like melts in your hand the second you put it in there just checking you put into your hand as if other moisturizerslike this pic C1 some mango sleep cream it doesn't become water because it still looks like the cream so I totally recommend this it lays you're like literally or makeup perfect go spend your money on this right now.
