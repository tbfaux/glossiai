bound2glo reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is glossier's cloud paint and beam as you can tell it's very well-loved very well use I think it's really important when making his kind of reviews that the people that you're watching you know that they're actually using the product I've had this since it came out on the gloss gay rap really love this product that's my favorite kind of blushed so going to put it on and show you guys what it looks like the glow look is coming together so what I do is just take a little bit of this and just pop it on the apples of my cheek and just blah I think it's really great again for this glow look because of the super subtle color it doesn't like wash me out but it really does go with my skin tone I think I'm more than just like a really lighter pink on it as that just like a little bit of flush to my brown cheek so I I would again recommend this all day everyday I use this almost every day so if you have any questions let me know
