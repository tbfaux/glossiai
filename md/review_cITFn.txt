missylissy reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys it's damn going to going to be reviewing the glossier cloud paint in the shade puff at first I was a little bit nervous when I order this because I do have oily skin and I usually do gravitate towards powder products on this is like more of a gel consistency however I was pleasantly surprised because I'm like a cream blush its then it's like a lick more of a liquid consistencies so it Blends right easily so this is what it looks like that's who was actually a little bit smaller than I expected I do find that a little goes a long way though so there's definitely enough in there to last for quite a while usually what I do is just thought it onto my skin with my fingers and then blend it out with a beauty blender and I just give you this great natural flushif you could tell I love how it is buildable so you could just keep adding until you get it how you want it overall I would definitely recommend this product even if you have oily skin like me
