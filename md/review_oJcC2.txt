Revah reviews Generation G by Glossier: hey guys it in with me showing you the generation G lipstick in the shade cake I got the good tube like they already upgraded it when I got it so that's good I've never had one of the ones that were like the bad tube people say so here is it's a really pretty color and then I went to I hit can just one slight can give you a natural color but you can also build it up so she that's one swipe and then that's a couple swipes this lipstick is really nice I really like it it's a tiny bit drawing so a lot of times I'll use the glossier balm.com lip balm on it over top of it when I wear it and that looks really pretty too but overall I really like this product I would recommend it I feel like it is my favorite lipstick now and I love it I'd recommend
