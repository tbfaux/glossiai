Elizaepp reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: pictures for the day I'm going to be reviewing Issaquah today at priming moisturizer just like all our products it's super cute packaging its cruelty free and is supposed to Prime and moisturize your skin at the same time with the weather changing my skin is super what's the weather changing my skin is super dry so I'm hoping and this will keep my makeup on and also have it look smooth and not like all dry and Flaky the pint-sized skin is very smooth and silky and a little bit goes a long way so say all their products this is making my skin feeling very hydrated and glow he and glossy so I would definitely recommend this product
