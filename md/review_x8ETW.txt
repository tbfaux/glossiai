Bmak0324 reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: here I have glossy is milky way home I just got this but I feel like I can give a pretty good review of it just because it's pretty simple and to the point so as you can see it's separated right now and you just shake it up like that and some people put it on a Compaq but honestly I squirted out of my hands and then I just kind of rub it around on my face and I think that works really great and then you're not wasting a cotton Pad but it doesn't burn my eyes out all I meant to waterproof makeup remover and I don't really wear waterproof makeup so I don't know how well it works with that but it works really great with my normal makeup and like I said it doesn't burn my eyes it makes my skin feel really smooth and it works great with obviously the Milky jelly cleanser which is my OG cleanser but yeah I really like it and I've been recommending its people it's kind of small I wish I was a little bigger but it's really not that expensive
