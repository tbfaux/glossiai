kariseward reviews Body Hero Daily Oil Wash by Glossier: okay so also I never realized that I never made a review about the glossy body hero so y'all can see what it looks like I've used it for like 2 years and body wash which is my go-to it prevent ingrown hairs it keeps away bumps it helps keep you fresher longer because honestly what keeps you fresh is getting dirt out of your skin and water and soap don't really do that as well as loyal does and spoil anything but it has a sense of like lavender a little Patchouli kind of another olive smell in there it's my go-to top shelf I love this you should try it also it's only like $17 so
