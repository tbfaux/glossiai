thebeautchronicles reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: so we just got finished washing off the glossier mega greens Galaxy Pack I forgot just how much I like this mask now this is a super creamy mask and it has Kaelin clay and then some oils like avocado to really help moisturize too well as a load to keep moisture into your skin instead of drying it out because of the clay this also has little scrubby bits in its leave your skin feeling really soft from gentle physical exfoliation I think this is perfect if you have acne prone combo skin like I do because it won't dry your skin out and it also will help moisturize while still detoxifying and helping clear up acne pimples and just really any congestion in the skin I do feel like glossier's a little overrated but this is one of their products that's really good and really worth a try and giving it a shot if you have combo acne-prone skin also thanks to my friend Jessica for letting me use
