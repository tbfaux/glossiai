sarah_novio reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: So lately I've been collecting skincare empties and my first one I want to talk about is glossier's bubble wrap so is .74 ounces for 26 bucks which I think is a pretty good price for what it is if they sleep lumps my under eyes and I put it around my mouth and especially around or starting to get these laugh lines and at least my skin Super Pump when I wake up the next morning and I highly highly recommend this
