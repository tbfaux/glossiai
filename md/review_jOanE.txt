jessierose reviews Super Glow by Glossier: alright keep in the serum train going we have the glossy a super glow which Crystal their packaging is so cute but this is the only bottle I've ever purchased for that because I don't feel like this does anything off of my skin like I'll put this on first of all it's so liquidy like it's crazy I don't personally notice a difference between this item is out of my face at all and never have I don't think that I don't really think this is worth it I read that vitamins at 10 to not work on a lot of people wouldn't say that you need it and you're at the car I definitely won't leave her sick cuz like I said $28 if it's deeper stare up for me personally
