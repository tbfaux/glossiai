riyahtaylor reviews The Super Pack by Glossier: glossier generation G I just got done and I'm about to go and learn to review classy Genji just because they're like an oldie but goodie I have two shades jam and like but I'm going to wear like today here is a side-by-side comparison to the old Genji and this one's the new Genji they did reformulated sometime last year and made it just chunkier and packaging just looks better instead of quality so yeah this is the perfect everyday live super comfortable as like a really nice tinted lips has like kind of like a bomb you feel but dries matte and this new formula is a lot clearer than the last one and less drying so
