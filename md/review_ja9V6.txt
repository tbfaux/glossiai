nevibaby reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: I love this priming moisturizer there's a lot of it which is really nice it's 1.7 fluid ounces and that's more than a lot of moisturizer and it's not super expensive so it's quite affordable it doesn't feel like heavy on your skin very soft smooth it smells kind of nice I think you'll like it if you try it raw CA I love all their products I've never had one that I didn't like so this is definitely another win for me
