amudaus reviews The Playground by Glossier: hey guys welcome back to part two of my glossy play the playground sets review so the next product I have is the vanilla clip and I got the color Pony so that is Pony also watched up in the camera looks really pink and red but actually it looks really like neutral brown pelican terracotta and I really liked the consistency and it was very easy to apply and it looks very very nice the final product and retailer I got the jelly in Phantasm the Glitters looks so so pretty and it's Festival season so I think he's would be perfect
