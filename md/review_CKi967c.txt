GlamGirl reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hi this is the glossy lash lift and hear the praetorian this mascara is very lengthening and she's very pretty and fluttery let me show you how to put it on I darken the room eyelash and bring it up word for the most length you can see very much of a difference from this side to the side. What's good for an everyday basis and the packaging is very very cute the one is perfect for the eyes lengthening look sometimes it'll be a little bit dry so I have the heat up with warm water but she's very nice and I love the pricklee want and so are these every day and is one of my top 10 mascaras and you can find a semi-gloss e.com and it is very nice and my favorite mascara thank you
