virginiac reviews Lidstar by Glossier: Jen going to be reviewing glasses lidstar in the shade Moon I really like this shade because it's a really natural and subtle so I'm just going to test out my hand and see how it look one thing I really like his applicator it makes it really easy to use it's really small so you can get it all over your eyelid so like I said before the shade is a really subtle but I like it because it's like silvery and glittering this is one of my favorite Shades because it's so natural and it's like a silvery glittery color another thing that I like to do is to put it over eyeshadow that I already have on this give it an extra glue and glitter and it's really easy to put over you know anything and spread around and you can just put it with your fingers it's just it's really easy to apply it's not that expensive I think it's $18 and I love the color in the glitter
