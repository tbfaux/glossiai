abril reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: hey guys so I realized I forgot to review my glossy lipsticks that I got with my super great going to talk about it so I don't really get acne anymore because they do use curology but there was an unexpected breakouts that happen identifying that when I use the glass hates it stick it wasn't really working that much as much as I like other products other achievements I haveand I kind of noticed that it was leaving almost like a little discoloration or like a little pads for my skin wasn't even for some time, but overall I wouldn't really recommend this part because it didn't really work that much I've definitely is better spot treatment so yeah
