legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: tastes great so I'm trying out Cloud paint samples again so this time I'm using the shape of which is the lightest shade of cloud paint that cause he has so just judging from like what it was on the what it looks like here I didn't really need it like it's nothing out my favorite color in terms of a blush cuz it's just a very very light pink I do have it on both cheeks now so I decided already put on my highlighter and decide I stopped before my highlighter and I was like I might as well show it before what it's like to see what it looks like with nothing else on top of it so as you can see it's like a very Barely There blush look I think if you're going for like a mark a Beauty look or just a more natural look this might be for you I was shocked by what it looked like when I opened it though cuz it's actually like on its own and it's actually more like a light neon pink rather than we just passed out like I said we passed out but it has a Disneyland look to it but Blended in a deadly isn't like me
