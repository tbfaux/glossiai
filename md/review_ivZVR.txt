abooogie_ reviews Generation G by Glossier: but I wanted to just jump on real quick and M just watch the Genji that I got in the shade Jam this is a sure that I've been wanting forever and I just didn't get it and then I got Leo and they got cake on here so I was like you know what I'm sure this out so this is like a damn colored like a purplish and I'm just wanted to see how it looks so oh that's really pretty tell me the benefit of this color is that since it's darker new you don't need that many swipes to get that color to take Leo but it's a beautiful color and I really like it this is Gem again
