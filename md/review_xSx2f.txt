maryfox04 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so I was on here while ago reviewing these three bomb.com said I got from glassy a I tried the coconut really liked it but I'm here to review a mint balm I really like this product it is enough product there's a lot of product in there I was hoping that would be minty and it is it is 20 and 70 more of a sweet torment compared to four examples of birds bees but I really like that's one of my favorite products this is more of a sweet mint that's more of amendment is kind of tastes like a Girl Scout cookies thin mint but like not complaining it's still good you still get that tingle feeling it still feels like it's doing something like like the Burt's Bees can feel it when it tingles so I do recommend this one I really like this one a lot I guess the next door come and review the rose so
