nevibaby reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: so if you know me you know that I'm an avid lover and fan of watier and I just noticed that I had never revealed This and like that does not sound like me anyway this is my favorite cleanser of all time so I have pretty much like a full face but like I guess medium tonight and I'm going to show you all how great it is so I got to do I do two pumps cuz I feel like that's enough for me and you can do it on your face dry which is like one of my favorite parts you just you do that I honestly just love how clean my skin feels after and yeah it's definitely my favorite I would recommend it so
