Beautaf reviews Super Pure by Glossier: hey guys it's so I'm not sure about this I don't know yet I haven't seen any noticeable results from using this but I haven't been using it like on an everyday basis I do not have a breakout prone skin but this says that's what it's for it says it's for breakout prone skin and redness and I do have some redness but again I haven't seen a noticeable difference I've been applying it just as a spot treatment on you know what the zones that I do need on my face I'm going to keep using this an update you on how I feel about it before now it's kind of more of a product thatit's a wishful thinking product where I use it hoping that it's going to do something but I don't know if it's actually doing something if that makes sense what I buy it again probably not because I sound like a skin care routine that works for me but please let me know if this does work for you and if you really like it educate me
