harmonym reviews Glossier You Perfume Solid fragrance compact and Glossier You eau de parfum by Glossier: I guess technically I can't make this video because I said of clause are you English say you saw one and for some time I only had the salad I know I'm pretty special I was getting a little. But they don't sell it anymore and it is a highly coveted item and I'm not getting rid of it and I barely use it for Christmas we added to the duo I finally got the actual perfumeI love it I've known that I've loved it for the longest time since my mom has it and I love it on her every single time that I smell it on her I guess that sounds weird but I didn't feel like spending $60 so thank you Christmas I love it and I recommended to literally anybody is like an amazing scent like 10 other than baby
