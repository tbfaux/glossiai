nelliegreer reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is Dawn just watched on my hand and asked me this is the most underrated Cloud paint color pigment because I think people are scared or intimidated maybe of this bright poppy color but it's actually one that I'm the most drawn to you and it's a little bride in my need to be Blended a little bit more but it's on my lips right now because one thing I'm not crazy about the cloud paint design is that too much comes out too fast so it product is easily wasted butit's also a really great lip stain so it just gives you this look like you just been on a jog with your cheeks are naturally flushed so I really like the color your body may need to tweak their design
