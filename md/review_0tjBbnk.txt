sparkling_aestheticsz reviews Futuredew by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy a future to I love how pretty this packaging is cuz it's like this iridescent kind of color future dude does have a pump at the top to apply the product this product is supposed to be used as the last step in your skincare routine to add an extra glow to use this product at the high points in my face kind of as a highlighter the back of the bottle recommend to use to Palms but I find that's way too much for my face so I only use one pump I do not recommend this product if you have oily skin it because it'll feel like you're applying a whole way of grease on to your skin when you use this product on my whole face I'm only going to apply it on the perimeters of my face because my T-Zone does get pretty loyally over all this product is best if you do have pretty dry skin and I think this is a decent product
