ksherbz reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: glossier lash slick is probably my favorite mascara of all time one of the big things I love about it is that it does not smudge at all on the way the formula is it physically can't smudge if it's going to come off your eyelashes it kind of flakes off but it doesn't even flake during the day really which is awesome I have very oily eyelids and this is pretty much the only mascara that actually lasts all day with talking to me raccoon eyes which is awesome and even though it's waterproof it's easy to remove
