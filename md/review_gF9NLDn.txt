sabenedek reviews Glossier set Lip Gloss and Lash Slick by Glossier: hi guys for Samuel reviewing the glossy lip gloss as you can see it comes in really cute pink packaging with little white applicator this is one of my all-time favorite lip glosses as you can see mines I can pretty much halfway done so I think that the applicator when you open it up it's super soft super great as you can see and the lip gloss itself is not sticky I all I know. Is always been a problem for me trying to find something that's not too sticky and clumpy on my lips so I'm currently wearing nothing I want to go apply this and then show you guys how amazing these are my lips after I applied so as you can see their super glossy I even think it makes it look a little bit bigger if that's possible and it's in a clear shade so it doesn't give color which I really liked and I just think the overall tentative time and would definitely recommend Five Guys
