emms917 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey I said I want to show you my favorite lip balm ever Evans of course the glossy balm.com I'm sure you've all heard of this before these lip balms are amazing I have two favors I have the mango and the rose Umberto show you before but these smell amazing and they feel so nice on the lips it says it has like a little bit of a coral tent this one but me personally like it doesn't really give much of a shit cuz I just like a nice shine but I love it I use this like almost every morning andyou can get like three in a bundle of pretty sure on their website which I think it's actually pretty good and this leaves your lips so moisturized I put it on at night sort of like a litmus and when I wake up my lips are so amazing that I add even more like in the morning so just makes you go to super hydrate and moisturize I definitely recommend this stuff
