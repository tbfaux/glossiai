LylaKelber reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: I want to share with my favorite dupes for the glossier boy brow if you don't put this on my eyebrows are pretty maintained and I think this does fine it it hold it in place but I found this one at Target itself and it's just like flash and brow it's $3 and when I put it on it just you can't really tell the difference now but it just kind of coats it in a way that makes it it makes a little bit harder to some people may not like that but I like it because it really keeps my brows walked in place during the day like if you touch it it's a little bit like hard but I think that's great because I like my address be like slicked back is still not super still look Supernatural so I love this product
