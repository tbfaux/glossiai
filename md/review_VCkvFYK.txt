theozhang reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hi so I'm reviewing the glossy milky jelly cleanser I recently started using this about two months ago maybe like one month ago and I found it to be really good the one thing I really love about it is that the texture is amazing and the scent is really nice its not overpowering at all its natural I think it's part of the greens cuz there's rose water in it the best part of it is that it removes or makeup although I do find that I need another remover that's fine because I double cleanse anyways but whenever I clean off my makeup with this especially I makeup it doesn't sting my eyes unlike some other ones I've tried before another thing is I feel like it's running out pretty fast but it's not that expensive anyways so I think it's pretty good and you should definitely try
