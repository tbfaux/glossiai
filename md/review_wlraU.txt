fourteencarrot reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: same reviewing glossier lip gloss this is the best I have it on my lips and a little bit on my eyelids right now you can see it just reflects the light beautifully it's just the right amount of stickiness I actually like it to be a little bit tacky cuz I feel like it stays in place and it doesn't wander all around my face I love this stuff it looks great this is just on my natural lips with no color it looks awesome on top of lipstickyou can see it's just the most delicious texture it looks pink but there's really not a lot of color to it overall this is my Holy Grail love it
