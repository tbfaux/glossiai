JayciNicole reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: hi guys I'm reviewing today this glossier priming moisturizer I love this product in the mornings that's the first thing I put on my face before I do screen or ice cream or anything like that but I think it's really good to put makeup over the top of just feels like a moisturizer it doesn't feel like a primer so if you like that and grip in the stickiness it doesn't have that I don't personally like it I like a really lightweight moisturizer on the top so I feel like this is really good for that I just so you guys could see what it looks like just a basic white cream and I just put it all over my face I don't know if you can tell a difference or not probably not I feel like this is the kind of thing that you won't really notice a difference in your makeup but in your skin you will so it's more skin care Focus which is kind of what glossy a does but yeah it's just like so good you can layer another primer with it if you do want more of a grip I just a really good product I definitely recommend it
