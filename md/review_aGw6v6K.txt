renchen reviews Colorslide by Glossier: so this is a review of glossier plays color slide I'm wearing two colors fuzz club and hardcore velvet I would say that we have to apply a lot of pressure to get a good amount of coverage and it does rub off upon immediate application but if you just let it stay on I believe it won't come off easily solid 4.5 Stars
