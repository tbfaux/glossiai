_emilymarie reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: this is glossier's new milky oil is a waterproof makeup remover and it is a mixture of my cellar and some type of oil can you forget but I really like this I love the applicator cuz you can just squeeze it directly onto your reusable cotton pad and it's really nice I find it this does really melt off my makeup really well and I love that after I use it my eyes and just around my eyes feels condition rather than stripped like most makeup removers do so my eyes actually feel hydrated and my eyelashes and eyebrows feel just really nice and soft after I use this and then I also follow this up with the Milky jelly cleanser and it's just the perfect Duo never strips my skin but gets all the gunk and makeup off
