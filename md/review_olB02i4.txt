miarenee reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: High B12 today I'm doing if you want me glossier lash slick this is by far my favorite mascara ever I love the packaging of it's super cute in minimalistic and it makes your lashes look super long and natural and it doesn't make them chunky at all with a lot of scars do I don't remember the exact price but I believe it's around 16 to $18 a great price for what you're getting this was one of the first Class C products that I received and I got it months ago and I'm almost out I will definitely be rehearsing this is what the lawn looks like as you can see there really tiny ants inwhich is great for lengthening they ignore that I'm breaking out but these are my regular lashes without mascara and I'm just applying a little bit here my lashes with mascara I put on weird so that's why it looks like that but it's really good anyways I highly recommend you get this product
