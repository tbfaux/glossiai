Daniachenail reviews Glossier Phase 1 Set by Glossier: hi I said I'm going to be reviewing the classiest solution exfoliator and the Super bounce serum so this thing is really good on this is the chemical exfoliator so this is really good to help out ask acne scars and a little bit of like acne on your T-Zone this really help me to get it out this is one of my favorite products the tips that I would give is that if you use it in the morning and you have to put sunscreen because your skin is going to be prone at UV light next to see glossier Super bounce this is a great hydrating serum are you still in the morning and at night it's really my favorite thing ever and I would totally recommend the price range for these two is okay as a little bit expensive but against glossy are so so pretty high-end brand create format great bottle there's a lot of products and also before my foot this is like this which is really easy to use I would totally work
