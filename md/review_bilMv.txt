danielarecommends reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: I wanted to share a couple of my thoughts on glossier's milky jelly cleanser I'm sure everyone knows about this I got this during the time that like everyone was using this at our first come out unfortunately I don't think I will be your purse thing less for cleansers I want something that's going to take all of my makeup off and I know this claims to do that but I just don't think this is it doesn't emulsify enough on my face and I never feel like my skin has been really cleaned after I use this however I do think this works well for people that have sensitive skin because it is very gentle
