daisyj reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: I'm going to be wearing glossier's bubble wrap I and Lip Cream I use it everyday on my lips no matter the makeup look on look at you trying to portray but for my eyes I only use it on days where I want to really make my eyes and Main feature of the look because it makes my eyes pop out more so basically what I do is I wash my face I take a little bit on my finger I put it under each eye and then I moisturize and then I do my makeup and it makes my eyes seem bigger and pop out more and then before I put lipgloss on I put a quick layer on my lips but it kind of sink in and then add my ChapStick in the busit always makes my eyes pop and my lips feel better it is one of my favorite products I definitely recommend
