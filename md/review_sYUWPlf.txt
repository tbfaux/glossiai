reflektor reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: so I bought this glossy a sunscreen back at their store in West LA and this is like the texture that it comes out as it's going to kind of weird but it is really lightweight don't mind my crazy hair but sunscreen goes on really lightweight and beer I can imagine that you can put makeup over it because it does kind of feel like a primer it kind of smells like banana boat or whatever that sunscreen is bad like face of the kids but yeah it's a little tacky but it's not really too bad I said screen that has 35 SPF so it feels nice.
