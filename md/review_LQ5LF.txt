maryfox04 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so I reviewed these about five times I think this is the fifth time and I'm sorry about that but I just really wanted to say that I think that this is a good product to buy and spend your money on I'm definitely is expensive one of these I think it's like $15 or $16 which is I would not pay for one of these I know but I got these innisfree pack you can get three pack and they're $12 each so you're saving money I think you say like $6 which is which is a good deal kind of but I was saying earlier that like you can find a child sit out there that's cheaper and I just just as good but I honestly think that these are very good chapsticks they are moisturizing there's a lot of product and then they're going to last you a super long time you can get ones that are tinted I just think these are a really good natural look and I really would recommend all of them so definitely 10
