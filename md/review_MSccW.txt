raggafragga reviews Wowder by Glossier: so recently I had the opportunity to go to a glossy a pop-up because they opened what I've been Seattle which is right where I live I got a couple of things but in particular the saying that I'm review today is the glossier wowder that hurts really badly thank you is is it's a really light coverage finishing powder mistaken it cost about 22 bucks and I ended up also getting the brush which I honestly wish I hadn't gotten because I have brushes like this but just cause about 20 and then in total it cost about 38 but I don't cuz 22 and 20 don't add up to 38 so this is a powder it's got a very airy like simple consistency obviouslyso this is the powder I was just put a little bit on the flash on then I put it directly onto my face there's a little piece of hair cool as you can see it's just got a very nice natural looking for
