mollia716 reviews The Playground by Glossier: but some reason the vanilla clip wasn't coming up in super great so I'm reviewing it under the playground so yeah this is the tube and this is the applicator this is what it looks like before you squeeze anything out so it's really fuzzy and like furry a couple times for it to start coming out but this is what it looks like so this is what it looks like with a couple layers on and this is a high shine lacquer so it's not sticky and it's not mad so it kind of just it's nice color on your lips and I really like it and feels nice the color is kind of like a mavi brown almost but still would like a little bit of a pink tint not quite what I was expecting I saw a couple of pictures with people showing this but I think it's pretty good
