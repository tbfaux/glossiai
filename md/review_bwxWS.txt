mzudsiri reviews Wowder by Glossier: so the finishing touch that I have to my current glasses a look is the Wilder I have the shade light medium which you know how does themselves are pretty sheer so it's pretty forgiving if you end up going a little lighter or a little darker and I'm going lighter because I also like to use it under my eyes I really love the brush I think it's really great for pinpointing specific spots to mattifyI really like how mattifying and blurring the product is I personally don't have other face powders so this is the one that I use and I really like a lot but you know the Laura Mercier is good the Cody is great so whatever suits you
