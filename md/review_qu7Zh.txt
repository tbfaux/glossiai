AlmostAlli reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: yeah we got the glossy a zit stick you already know this was fries was super great points but I just got it today after I came home from a costume party was freaking and I'm going to do it first impression first-person present is it came in this like really aesthetically pleasing packaging I loved it and it also came with some stickers that if I my phone case they are but this is a little rollerball the active ingredient is benzoyl peroxide acne treatment gel it took me forever to get a new product come out of this thing to roll it on your little trouble areas your little face demons and I'm going to let it sit overnight and like I'll make an update I'll start using this and then see if it actually clears up Matt gets so likealso it doesn't smell it smells fine. I feel like that's important as well fine don't worry about it
