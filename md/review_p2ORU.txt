abooogie_ reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is one of my favorite glossier products it is their lips are which is like a liquid eyeshadow it doesn't move it doesn't transfer I mean I've worn these four hours of the day a whole work then I got home and they still look super beautiful super pigmented sparkly I'm sorry love these they're super easy to apply just has a lip gloss applicator brush where you guys how I do it I just pack it on like that and then I buff it out with my finger it is super buildable SF I want more intensity or more color I can definitely do that as well this is in the shade van for the purple color they do also have herb is like a green color on two other ones at least two of my favorite and color in that Shimmer that do ants sleep
