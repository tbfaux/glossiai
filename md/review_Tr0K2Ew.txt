vingyn reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: Cloud paint and beam we first got it was way smaller than I expected but it's fine here is it compared to the mini Too Faced lip injection when I squeeze it sometimes it is so much comes out and just splattered everywhere and it gets so messy which is something I really don't like about the bottle also if you're going to apply this over like a full face of makeup it's going to smudge your makeup from underneath I'm probably not going to buy it but I like it
