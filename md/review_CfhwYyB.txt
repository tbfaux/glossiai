imankadri reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: today and baby reviewing the glossier's stretch concealer this is honestly one of the best products I've ever tried for limiting my under eye circles without making them look super cakey if you're really into natural doing this and kind of a Luminous Finish that I definitely recommend this concealer only the glossy skin tint this actually packs a lot of pigment and can really limit the view of your acne scars and your under eyesas you can see there is a huge difference between are applied the concealer and where I didn't so this definitely makes a difference without making you look too cakey 10 out of 10 recommend
