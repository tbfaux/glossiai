earthismyheaven reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so I wanted to come on here to review the WASP avon.com that I have I'm going to be honest I think this product can be over height but I do really like it that being said I'm not the kind of person who needs to go out and get every single flavor or type of bomb.com gluten-free that I have I really really enjoy I love mixing these two are like a tropical taste I was just going to lay they picked up this one so I'm very excited about it so here are some swatches of the products and they match the placement behind them I love both of the tinted ones although I will say the mango flavor is a bit strong for me I wasn't sure if I wanted this one for when I went to the store the other day I needed that and lastly I will add that this is definitely my favorite one so far
