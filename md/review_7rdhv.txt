allthedew reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: so this is the glassy eye and lip Plumping cream I am always looking for a good hydrating eye cream and this is definitely a great option I think this has become one of my favorite eye creams ever has 74 fluid ounce which is actually more than your typical private plane which usually has a Cobalt Point 50 so I thought that was very generous especially for the price I would say that after applying this to my eyes it leaves a really beautiful like dewy finish works really well under makeup but for the lip portion of it I would say fuel pump is way too much I would say after rubbing it on to your eyes gently of course whatever is left on your fingers put that on your lips that actually does kind of help with live application but I would say that's not my primary use for this definitely for the eyes it's amazing I really love this stuff
