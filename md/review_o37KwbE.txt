ameliasaylor reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: play I'll be reviewing this. This is a beautiful place is glassy-eyed and it is a tinted one it's a beautiful color and I'm going to go ahead and apply I went ahead and applied it as as you can see it looks stunning every turn to take it gives it a nice semi gloss and I think it looks beautiful how to search up the price for those but I believe it is not too expensive they also sell this in clear glasses a lighter than this and this so it's a great product and I really recommend you getting it and it's worth to spend the money but I believe it is a pretty low price product hope you guys have a great day and love you bye
