devinkielle reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: I don't know what happened I did record a Swatch on the last Ferry bomb.com review but for some reason it got cut off so I just want to show you guys the color payoff is really gorgeous this is a little heavy this watches but to me it doesn't show this deep on the lips but it's gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous specially for chocolate girls
