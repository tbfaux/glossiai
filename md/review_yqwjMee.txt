jenica reviews Colorslide by Glossier: hi everyone I'm going to review this product called color Slide by glossy a play it is the sub genre of glasses I love them and so today I'm wearing the shade early girl has he can see and usually I put Bragg which is like brown and black up in my water line so I look like I have Fuller lashes and this is also critical mass and whatever they like about these pencils that it's really smooth and they do not transfer once they dry down so if you can see they literally not going anywhere and I have oily eyelids and everything I put on I like smudges but I'm really happy that these don't that's why I like to wear them all the time you should try them out
