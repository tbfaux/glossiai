missylissy reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so you're a have a glossier lidstar in the shade Fawn I recently picked this one up I'm a big fan of these would sorry I picked this one up it's like a Topia shade with a hint of purple I thought this would be the perfect way to darken up my makeup look a little bit for fall but still keep it pretty natural so these lid stars are very easy to apply you just put it straight onto your eyelid and blend it with your fingers so I applied it to both of my eyelids it just gives this really hints of like Smokey look I find out these Woods stars are different than any other liquid eyeshadow because these are marketed as a iglow so they don't add a ton of Shimmer they just add this glow and this subtle hint of color they're also buildable and just pray
