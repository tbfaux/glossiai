Avadickinson reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to do a product review any glossier Cloud paint and puff the first of all the packaging was adorable so what I'm going to do is I'm going to open it and I'll take just a little squirt of it but my finger and I'll just put it right on the cheek number to blenders out on the cheek I mean look at that before and after this before after now I'm going to do my other cheek so this is the final look I really like it so my overall review for the cloud paint is that it's really blendable you can blend it with your fingers or the beauty blender I prefer my finger so because the beauty blender could absorb it this will give you a Sunkist
