milamenges reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys this is the glossier balm.com in the original flavor of shade I guess and it doesn't smell like anything then the packaging is really cute but I prefer it looks clear like this he can't see it but it is a good lip balm because it's very moisturizing but I prefer the other flavors in this like the birthday cake flavor for the rose flavor those are the two other ones I've tried I like those a lot better than that one so yeah
