beautybymonamarie reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey what's up guys I just wanted to do a quick demo using the glossier lidstar in the shade herb all right now I'm wearing two Shadows from the colour-pop so jaded palate let me show you I have Geodude in my crease and I have Jade on my outer Corners just add a little bit of death so super quick and easy to use you just glad it on Blended out with your ring finger and it provides just like a beautiful wash of sheer color I really like the shade because it has a green base but when you look closely that's some golden reflex in there that's very nice
