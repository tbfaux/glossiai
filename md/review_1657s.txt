kateglavan reviews You, Solid Perfume by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to be reviewing glasya you it is there solid perfume I'm going to show you a little bit about how it looks how it opens and what it smells like it had this for a while so it's a little bit beat up that's one thing that kind of is unfortunate about it but it slides open and you can apply it to your wrists with just like a little bit of application and it doesn't leave any residue look at other solid perfumes I've dealt with there's a very woodsy at fruity scent it stays on longer for me than a liquid perfume I find and it's so cute to just slide this in a purse that's like my favorite part about it is like taking out of my bag when I'm on the go and just having This Little Light cute pink egg and once again a little goes a long way so I think this is like a very cost-effective purchase for how long it will last you compared to a liquid proof you so I totally recommend this guy so cute once again got the glossy paint going
