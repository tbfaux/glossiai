Style_with_Audrey reviews Glossier You Perfume Solid fragrance compact and Glossier You eau de parfum by Glossier: before I start can we please petition glossy a to bring back the bomb version of the glossy a perfume this smell doesn't really complete until you put it on and I would describe it as a sweet musky but little bit spicy but also really warm it just smells like a very optimistic person and I am one of those so I think this is perfect for me I just also really love how easy it is to open this and you can apply it very easily just stop it on and the bomb version actually lasts a little bit longer than the liquid version so I can't wait for them to hopefully bring back this bum versionit even comes with a tiny little pouch
