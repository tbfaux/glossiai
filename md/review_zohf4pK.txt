teresapecher reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hi guys so I'm going to be reviewing the glossier milk jelly cleanser have it right here I have it in the smaller size but yeah this honestly I just put on my face and I feel like it really made my skin smooth but I have been using it and it has really done much for my breakouts but it definitely makes my my skin feel pretty smooth and soft and it feels like healthy it feels like that layer of gross stuff that's on your skin is gone it feels pretty fresh here's the consistency I'll just pump some to show youso I don't know if you can see that it's really like milky but it feels pretty nice and it doesn't really is kind of has like a explain this smell like, smells like like bubble so but if it was really nice on and if it's not too bad I'd give it maybe a 7 out of 10
