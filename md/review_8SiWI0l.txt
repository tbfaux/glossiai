iambahar reviews Futuredew by Glossier: hi guys I'm really excited to make this review because this is one of the products I really really love it is the glossy future do and what this does is it just adds like a nice glow to your face and I'll show you guys what I mean okay so I have nothing on my face right now I pumped a little bit of this product onto my finger and we're going to apply it right here all I did was read that in with my finger and I don't know if you can tell but do you see that glow I know I can see the side of my face is not shining but look at that and don't worry it is not tacky at all and it melts right into your skin and feels like a serum iron oil before going out to the glossy website I did not know about this but I really recommend it's really nice I use this everyday to add a Natural Glow to the highest points of my face like my nose and my cheek bones
