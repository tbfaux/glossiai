hollandgolde reviews Generation G by Glossier: I just took a nap so if you're wondering what this line is it's from my nap so this is a product maybe demoing it is the glossier generation G the packaging is super minimal but I think it's so cute and then this is in the color kick some ass watch it on my hand first and as you can tell it's very sure but super pretty color I'm going to do a before-and-after so you can see exactly how much color is in the lipstick and all that who is it after I really like the color and I think it gives like a cool like blotted natural lipstick color which I really like personally
