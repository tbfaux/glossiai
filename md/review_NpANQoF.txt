milamenges reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: this is the glossier lip gloss in the clear Shea this is so pretty I absolutely love it it looks like this dablicator is like this fuzzy type of one it says it has a really pretty packaging but it is super tiny and I feel like it's time an average lip gloss for $14 I mean this one was way less and feel like it kind of the same thing but I mean I guess you're paying for the brand but it is really pretty and I do recommend it
