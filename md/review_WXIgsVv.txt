Style_with_Audrey reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: this product needs no introduction I am pretty sure at this point lot of people have tried out the Milky jelly cleanser and I've seen pretty polarized reviews for me it's like a mad product it's fine if you already have pretty grade skin condition it does exactly what it says to do which is to cleanse I use this in the morning but my skin feels really comfortable and after a full night's rest and skin already feels pretty plums and I just use this to sort of wash off the excess oil that collected overnight a has a a jelly milky textured again similar to what the name says it is very comfortable on your skin and it is pretty easy to wash off it doesn't leave your skin feel sticky but what I be purchased is probably not but I do love the packaging
