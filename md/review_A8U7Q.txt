discobeautie reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: okay so the glossier priming moisturizer I use this anytime I do my makeup it's super hydrating so if you're wanting more like a matte makeup finish I wouldn't use this this is more like for like if you want to get glowy kind of do we look so I usually just stood about like a little bit a little dollop and just rub it all over and then let it dry a little bit cuz it is like moisturizer so it's still going to be really hydrating like I said but I feel like makeup really like clings to it pretty well and it can help like my makeup last all day
