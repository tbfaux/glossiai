thekristynedit reviews Generation G by Glossier: hey guys so the products that I chose for Pisces is glossier Generation G lipstick in the shade like now the reason that I chose this for Pisces is because I find that Pisces are very very very creative and they're very very emotional so sometimes it comes to expressing their creativity and they do it in like subtle ways but ones that are very noticeable if I make any sense so we think that this lipstick which is what I have on right now is a very subtle but very flattering very pretty lipstick now it's all so cool about this as you can really build it up so if you want to really like in our Bama express your creativity then you can build it up it's also fun to mix with other colors since it is so sheer Ciara I just really like this product and I think that if you are a Pisces you love it too
