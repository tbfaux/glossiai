mzudsiri reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: so today I have a review of glasses perfecting skin tint I have the shade dark which is from the older line before they expanded the shade range which is great and now I believe this is a shade 6 or 7 I shake mine up and I'm going to apply it to my face and then I'll share some more my thoughts with youso you probably didn't really notice too much of a difference if anything it kind of evens my skin tone maybe reduces redness by little bit I like it just to put something on in the morning smells like as a base for other Foundation but over all by itself
