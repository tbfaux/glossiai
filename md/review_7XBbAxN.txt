glowquest_ reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: hey guys I wanted to just give my honest opinion of the glossier zit stick the packaging is really cute it clicks up like that and then you can just roll it on which is very convenient but on the other hand the main ingredient in this is benzoyl peroxide at 5% so it's somebody that's been using like spot treatments from the drugstore for quite a whilethe main ingredient in all of those are Neutrogena Clean & Clear is either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide so for much cheaper you can go to the drugstore and pick up like Clean and Clear Neutrogena the house brand Burgess like a couple bucks and it's going to be the same ingredient so if you want this packaging and easy application and go for it if not go to the gym
