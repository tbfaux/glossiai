danielarecommends reviews Niteshine by Glossier: hi everyone so I just wanted to share my first impression thoughts on glacis nightshine I picked up the shade dark copper were deep copper I think one of those I picked it up out the glossy a store in La and here are a couple of my thoughts so the formula for this is very different from the Halo scope highlighters like the original highlighters that glossy a has those are very sticky and more liquidy and Dewey whereas this once you apply it onto the skin at like dries completely the the pigmentation is awesome am I haven't had any issues with it fading so yeah I'm honestly really really happy with this and I think this shade is perfect for summer so I would highly recommend the shade
