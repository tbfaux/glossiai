emmaa reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys I know it's been a really really long time since I made a review but have a bunch of new products now so I just want to share them with you guys so about a month ago I went down to class your Miami and I got a bunch of new products will not new products but which products from the first Minute review the cloud paint and puff I do have it on but I put it on the beginning a day so it's kind of went off but I will watch it I mean it's the cult classic puff so for those of you who are not familiar with the cloud paint formula it is a liquid cream blush and you just need a very sheer wash to get a lot of payout and result so they can only put more than happy to see how things and just gives you a ride Rosie love you can see right here I do think they are good price Plus have a lot of combo deals so I do suggest
