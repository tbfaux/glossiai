allegram reviews Generation G by Glossier: hi so I am reviewing the glossier generation G lipstick in cake when you open it it looks like this is really cute and this is the shade I really liked this formula because you can build it up really easily but you can also just have like a little shade of color and that's just like a little wash of color this reminds me of the Mac Velvet Teddy and I really like this and it kind of smells like roses too if you like that
