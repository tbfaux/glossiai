emthegem reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: hi everyone I am reviewing the glossier brow slick I just put some glossier boy brow and my eyebrows shape round for both of these I use this to go in if there's any missing parts on my eyebrows a very thin eyebrows so it helps in the little spaces I'm even see this one's a lot darker I went in with this one heavier and then I went in with this one later so you can come and see the difference between the two I love this product especially with someone like me who has more of a natural look to their makeup so I very do we light makeup so I have your eyebrows I personally don't like as much so this gives the very like natural finish that I love my man is on the price your side again but I just love it so much that I'll probably keep buying it and I highly recommend 10 out of 10
