paugzzf reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hello so this is actually my first product from glossier it's the boy brow in brown and just Renee was the first date by Design and I really liked it I usually don't like any products for my brows because I don't know how to wear them or I make them as in my cell so this was actually pretty easy to use and it looks very natural so that's one thing that I like so yes I will totally recommend this product
