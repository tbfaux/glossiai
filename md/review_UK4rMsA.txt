allthatskincaress reviews You, Solid Perfume by Glossier: this is the glossier You perfume one of the most beautiful beautiful solid perfume that I've ever seen I absolutely love this product it's so luxurious don't sell it anymore which is so so sad I'm really glad that I got my hands on this is going to put your thumb here and then slide it out as you can see I've used this quite a bit I've definitely hit pan on it but I'm scared to it like finished using it because I meanthere aren't they don't tell us anymore but yeah there's this I would have definitely 100% repurchase it if they still sold it I'm contemplating getting the spray version but I just love how adorable the solid version is and this is just a little pouch that I comes in and I would 100% recommend has love the scent but it's they don't sell it anymore
