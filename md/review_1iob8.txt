amudaus reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so this is the original bomb.com this was my old least favorite bomb.com the only reason I ranked it last is because it has no sense and I really like sense of smell good and the rest is smells so so nice and fun and tropical that just this had to go last she can tell this product is untinted so the fact that it's not tinted and it doesn't have a sense like it's just so boring compared to the other bomb.com that this this has to go last in my ranking of all the bomb.com none the less it's still a good product it's still super moisturizing I just don't prefer using at my lips because it's haunted my likes things that smell good if I use it on my cuticles my elbows but it is a nice project that has no sense
