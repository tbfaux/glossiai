gmdlife reviews Generation G by Glossier: so if my first met you I thought I would do a glossy product because I really do love this brand and I think just today they announced that they're reformulating these and now the new ones are for sale and this is the new generation G lipstick in the shade jam it won't focus but Jam so this is it on my lips it's a really nice Matt Berry shade the problem that I had these was that it took a bunch of liars to apply evenly and it's settled into my lines but I'm going to purchase the new formulation and hope that the consistency is better cuz I love the color and these just to show you are the colors that they have they have all the same colors still but they just changed the formula and the packaging is a bit different and that is a Swatch of jamwich I just had on
