oliviafrescura reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: my favorite eyebrow product lately has been the glossier boy brow and I use the shade Brown it has this cute little brush that's perfect for at getting into every nook and cranny of your eyebrow I like it because it's filled in your brows and keeps them in place in one product so you don't need to use like an eyebrow filling product and an eyebrow gel cuz this is the new left with natural not Instagram eyebrows
