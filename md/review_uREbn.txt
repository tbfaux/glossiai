holakata reviews Generation G by Glossier: it sounds like so I really like this one because it's actually purplish but it comes on a little different it's different with every skin tone but overall I love how she wrote it is and you can kind of go out of the line of your lips but not too far it's really easy to do a smudged lip look with this to I love it
