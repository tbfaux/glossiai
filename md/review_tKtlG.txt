Beautaf reviews Super Glow by Glossier: okay so to be honest I'm a huge fan of Garcia's I will recommend and probably force you to buy any of their products but this is something I'm just not sold on I got it a while ago and I've been using it on and off because it's just something that I don't really see any of the benefits from it I've actually started using it under my eyes since it is like a vitamin C brightening serum and I like to put a few drops in the palm of my head put it under my eyes and then just stop whatever is left of it all over my face but it's not something that I see a significant difference after using I don't think it's impacted my skin definitely not worth expensive it is so I don't know
