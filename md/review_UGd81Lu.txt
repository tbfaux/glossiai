clairelizzy reviews Skywash by Glossier: I ordered the glassy Sky wash matte eyeshadow right before we were all in quarantine I was really excited about it but then I haven't really been wearing makeup because I've been so this is my first impression I love the packaging it's really slick and mad these are the colors I bought it's this one's of Valley and in the dark brown psycho so I'm actually going to do tutorial of these as well cuz I never use them so we're going to try this out together
