Glamrie563 reviews Colorslide by Glossier: everyone so I know I never did individual reviews on glossy a playground collection so I'm going to do that now this is the color slide pencil in the color Adult Swim this is what it looks like Swatch it's just a really nice dark blue eye of the state of mind that you can totally use really dark, really any color but especially dark colors like blue and purple Highlanders because why not I have to be honest I'm not really an eye pencil girl I'm prefer especially for like colored or more intense liners I definitely like a liquid formula this one's okay here it is on my left eyelid looks really pretty but you can tell it's a little patchy you definitely need to go over it a couple times it doesn't have like the gel Cole consistency that it advertises I feel like it's more just like a standard eyeliner pencil which is kind of disappointing cuz he has such a pretty colors make that if you felt differently than let me know this is just okay
