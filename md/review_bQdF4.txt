mzudsiri reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: I own a lot of Elf makeup brushes they are my favorite makeup brushes to use and the one that I use the most is the small stippling brush I actually use this to blend my glossier cloud paint in I think it's the perfect size for my cheeks it gives me a lot of control and they're easy to wash I have a lot of different kinds but this is definitely the one that I used the most the second one that I use the most is there tiny blending eyeshadow brush I use that every day as well I definitely think that they do a great job and they're super affordable I think they're like three to $6 this one's on sale right now for and you can get it for a dollar twenty so definitely highly recommend you try this brush or you try a couple other brushes
