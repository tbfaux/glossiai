abaldleo reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to be reviewing glossier's milky oil waterproof makeup remover so I haven't ever actually use this product I just got it in the mail today so I'm really excited to show it and tried for you guys comes with a nice little bit on my hands all right we put it on I whip my hands a little bit before putting it on I don't really have any face makeup on so let's see oh my God oh my God as amazing as you can see that did not take very long I don't ever wear primer but I do wear anastassios dipbrow. So she's on pretty well in the fact that I've got that all set quickly is pretty impressive okay so I really like this product go get it
