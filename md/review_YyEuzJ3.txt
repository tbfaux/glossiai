jalynv reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: case I'm not here is looking a little weird but just bear with me okay so next I use the glossy a bubble wrap as an eye cream and I don't really know if it helps was like dark circles but I definitely noticed it with like pumping my under eyes I think it really helps and it's like in this aluminum little canister so that I like you too cold I know like we put on it's like really refreshing I don't know I just yeah I do like a half pump cuz I feel like a full pump is a lot and then I just go under first an any excess I take it on my eyelids because your eyelids are important to so and then I take it out over here tooit smelled like I'm trying to find it smells like I can't explain it but it doesn't really have like a fragrance or like anything like to like you know how
