Emma_mwah reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: alright guys I'm sorry I look kind of like a hot mess right now I'm still sick but for like the past month or so I've been obsessed with this class a milk jelly cleanser so I've got this on Christmas and I've been keeping it by skincare fridge and I like to use this in the mornings I'm at has a really nice texture I'll just pumps about real quick it's like a clear like jelly of course is really smooth and what I like about it is that it's super moisturizing and I have I have really dry skin so in the winter it helps me a lot and accuse my face really nice and like hydrated and when after you wash it off if it's super plump and nice and it's just a great way to start your day so invest cuz I know they have smaller sizes so that would be like a perfect tester if you want to just try it out real quick definitely recommend and also have a skincare fridge use that cuz it makes it a hundred times better
