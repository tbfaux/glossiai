vegamfrancine reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: Hello friends I'm about to review that unless a seed stick I haven't using this for a while now and I think it's been long enough to for me to have like a whale. Review on this product I have mixed feelings about it I used it very recently to treat a hormonal pimple I got in my chin and honestly it's nothing around breaking my opinion it doesn't like get rid of my pimples overnight and maybe these people was just like a monstrous people but I think I have things that work better than this product so it's a mess for me
