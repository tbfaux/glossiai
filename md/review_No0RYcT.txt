thatgoodglow reviews Glossier You Perfume Solid fragrance compact and Glossier You eau de parfum by Glossier: I'm here to review the glossier You perfume it was really appealing to me at first because glass CA website said that it had a lot of musk so it kind of changes and adapts to whatever your natural chemistry of your body and your skin is so that really appealed to me I think that the undertones are slightly Grandma e like this is a more mature sent for sure it's not very sweet which is what I usually go for but overall I do really enjoy this project at last really well if you're looking for more of a mature subtle sense than this is definitely the perfume for you
