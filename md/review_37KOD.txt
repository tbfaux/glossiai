nelliegreer reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: okay this is a glossy a priming moisturizer so as you can tell I really love this product of used quite a bit of it it has a slight mauve tone to it which helps to neutralize skin tone and I'm a huge fan of any primer that is a two-in-one with a moisturizer at kind of kills two birds with one stone so before putting on your makeup you get some added nutrients and hydration to your skin I really like to smell personally I think it has a lavender a lavender herbal smell is not overbearing by any means that and just a pretty good job luring pours but I would say it's more moisturizing than that but I really enjoy it and its favorite
