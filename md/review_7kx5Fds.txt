makeupbyzo reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to be talked about the glossy elastic mascara this is the best mascara if you want a really natural lash this is such cute packaging first of all and I think he is a rubber Sandra and if you want a really not to laugh just like for everyday or if you're not a full Glam type of girl then I had a hundred percent recommended it gives pretty good following him and it's not pumping at all so if you are into that kind of sweet natural look totally recommend by guys
