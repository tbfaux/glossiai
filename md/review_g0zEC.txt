ontheglowNYC reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: I'm going to be reviewing what a my favorite glossy a products in a new shade on new it's new to me this is cloud paint in the shade beam so you can apply this like with a blender or brush if you want but I kind of like doing makeup kind of just you know with a little tap top of my hands so we took the smallest amount and that was probably still too much but yeah a little goes a long way with this product so I'm just going to rub it in a little Lake warm it up so I don't push blush right here cuz it makes my cheeks look like root beer so this product is really cute too if you want to look like you have a little sunburn
