sona reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: everyone today I wanted to review with the classy a cloud paint which is a tri color of blush but it comes in a liquid form and it comes in this little package and even though the packages is pretty small there isn't really much in there which is something I noticed when I squished the packaging a little bit but a little bit goes a very long way so I'll squeeze some pigment out onto my finger and this is really not much and all debit on to my cheeks and then I'll just blend it out as you can see that tiny little amount gave me pretty Rosy Cheeks no I'm not a huge I'm not a huge blush girl but I think this might just convert me and this is my color desk
