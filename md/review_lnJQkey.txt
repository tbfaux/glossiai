helenemmert reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so this is the glossy eye concealer it's a really good stretch concealer perfect for dry skin and I love the packaging but when I first got it and looks kind of empty I don't know if you can see here but the bottle looks practically empty but once you open the product you can see there's actually a lot of product and a little goes a long way so you don't even need to use that much it's really hydrating perfect for dry skin and it's perfect for natural dewy look and I really recommend this product
