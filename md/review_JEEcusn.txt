susanna_1917 reviews Haloscope by Glossier: so this is a glossy Halo scope in the shade topaz and it's a really natural highlight and the inner core's and oil-based so it's really hydrating and it looks really natural so this is actually really easy to use you just apply it I like to play with my fingers cuz I heard that sometimes like if you just applied right on your cheek it takes off like your concealer or foundation so I have it on my finger still dark and you can just apply on cheekbones and it goes like a really natural I like the street maybe like a little too dark for me that's why you can see like a little bit of like difference in color but there's other Shades such as quartz that's like a really natural straight and he just looks really natural
