weirockz reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hi everyone today I'm reviewing the glossier lidstar this is the color slip it's a pinky yeah pretty much just pink right off the bat I'm just going to say that I bought this as an Impulse buy when I visited the store in New York and I fully regret it I think it was a waste of my money and I think that someone else might really enjoy it so I plan on giving it to one of my friends to see what they think it looked really good on me in store and I'm not really sure likewhy it looks so good in the store cuz they're lighting is Pretty Natural my main thing is for me it just creases and looks really patchy on my skin and I think it's because I have dryer skin okay if I put two coats on like I think it looks like okay like it barely looks like anything's there I don't think the other colors are that great this product just like Falls flat
