danielarecommends reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is glossier cloud paint in storm and this is definitely one of my Holy Grail products I think it's one of those Shades that looks good and the summer and in the winter just like any other Cloud paint I love the formula and I guess just a little tip is the way I like to apply Cloud paint as I like to dab it on to my cheeks with my finger and then take a regular blush brush and buff it into the skin I always find that last a lot longer but if your skin tone is similar to mine can kind of see how it looks on the skin it's just like a very nice flushed color so I would highly recommend this
