alissa30t reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hi guys it's Alyssa and today I am going to put on a lift for you guys I'm going to talk about one of my favorite lip combos that I have been loving I don't have anything on right now so I thought I would put it on with you guys and I have reviewed both of these products separately before so I have the heart and sealed I don't know if I'm pronouncing It Black Rose lipstick number one and then I also have the famous glossy a clear lip gloss so I use both of these to achieve a perfect everyday gloss so I'm going to show you what it looks like Stouffer's I'm going to use this lipstick which if you don't know what this is it's basically a black lipstick but it changes with a pH of your lips so at least my lips a pink color here that applied is very natural for the clear gloss over and then you go a great wearable natural look
