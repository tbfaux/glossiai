fourteencarrot reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: so for my first super great review I'm going to start with one of my holy Grails which is the class C A priming moisturizer rich what I love about this moisturizer is it's super creamy I think it's intended for a lot of people as a night moisturizer but I actually use it for my day because I have such dry skin the texture is definitely creamy but it melts into the skin I give myself a little face massage so just to show you how lovely it Blends in I just massage it get the blood flow going but one thing I don't like about it is that it isn't a pot I know that a lot of night creams come and Potts but it is not a sanitary so in the future that's something that I would love bossy to work on but other than that
