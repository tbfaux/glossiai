riyahtaylor reviews Wowder by Glossier: place a welder so I thought I'd give this a review because I've been using it for a while it's one of those products I have been using for a long time and it's not new so I didn't review it but it's such an amazing product and I got a new packaging so I thought I would just give it a quick review today here's the old packaging here's the new one I much prefer this one so I didn't wake up early this morning so I'm just going in for a touch-up and this product is really great it's like you best light powder that I have if you open up the packaging is amazing it has the so it doesn't like real messy but it's really nice and light but mattifies your face but doesn't make it flat or chalky and it really does for the poreswe're going with this brush and I can see on my nose see that just gives you like a nice lick healthy mat does make you look dry
