theozhang reviews Lidstar by Glossier: is the glossier lidstar worth it won't let me tell you I think they are mainly because they're really pigmented and really beautiful I have a color and cut it is a gorgeous color is a Rosy gold color I think and work really well in anyone's Cantone is quite pigmented and also super shimmery although you think that she colors don't look natural they really do look natural hair today I used it in a less natural-looking way as you can see I filled in the cut crease right there and it still looks really good it's super pigmented and I'm really happy about it they will cost you about $18 and even though that is pricey for like 1when I Shadow I still think it's a really good product and completely worth it for its money especially for someone who doesn't usually do makeup a really spruces up the look
