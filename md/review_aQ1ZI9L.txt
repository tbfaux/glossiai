milamenges1 reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: hi guys this is the glossy a bubble wrap eye and lip Plumping cream and okay so first of all the packaging is really cute and you take off the top and it comes in like a little pump through thing it does kind of dry on your lip sing really fast so it's not like a lip balm or anything and it's kind of thin for your eyes but if you do want something Cyn and I think that's a good product if you want something sticker I would recommend this Clinique All About Eyes Rich cream that's really nice of you guys but anyways overall it's a good product just not the best
