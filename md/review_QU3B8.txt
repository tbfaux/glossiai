sarahjgomez reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: so today I'm going to tell you guys about the glossier mega greens Galaxy Pack mask I put on my face today on for about can put on a sooner later for a short amount detoxifying my pores when I take it off it's just an overall nice mask the one thing I do have to say about it though is that the smell is definitely unpleasant it's not personally I don't like it at all but I think I can withstand the smell for my skin and is currently my favorite mask and you guys should totally try it out
