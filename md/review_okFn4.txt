mollia716 reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: play I'll be reviewing glossy lash slick so first I'm going to curl my lashes with eyelash curler and then I'm going to apply lash slick so I've applied it to this I knew as you can see it's well-defined then this is it without lash slick this is what the brush looks like so it's got these little tiny brush hairs that help to Fan out your lashes and apply the mascara evenly overall I would recommend this mascaraand I'll probably get it again once I run out cuz I like how quickly it dries and that it stands out my lashes and makes them look longer than they are
