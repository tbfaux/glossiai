theozhang reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so I'm reviewing the glossier's stretch concealer and honestly and also this isn't shade light the lightest one so I love this one at first I actually kind of hate it cuz I thought emphasizes my texture but I just had a pet it in with my finger cuz it didn't work with a brush because it was like just a dryer crusty skin you have to really like precedent the warmth of your finger and I don't know sponge would do the job because it's it's quite a moleon and like hydrating so I can spend with soaked up a lot of it but like look at the difference so this is me because I don't sleep enough and this is the one with the stretch concealer and honestly how much are differences it's so gorgeous and it doesn't look very unnatural either it looks just like my skin you can layer it even more if you wanted to phone leasing I have about it is that it will Kris but it's not a problem if you said it or you just don't wear it for very long and CZ compact back into shape
