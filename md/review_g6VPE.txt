missylissy reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so here I have the glossy A Lash slick mascara I've already used it a few times so I've already developed my thoughts on it so I always curl my lashes before I put on my mascara so I'm going to do that real quick call me crazy but I have a routine where I need to press it nine times on each eye I don't know why but anyway let's move on to the mascara so this is the one it's Rubber and has a bunch of tiny little bristle I do like that when you take it out it doesn't take too much product with its like the perfect amount so I'm going to apply it now so this is what the mascara looks like
