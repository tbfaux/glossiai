maryfox04 reviews Super Pure by Glossier: okay so next time reviewing this glossier serum and this helps with redness and breakouts which I don't get many breakouts which I'm very blessed for but I do get redness so I put this on overnight or before I put on makeup cuz it also helps with a nice glow but it's very hydrating and oily on your skin some of these really really understand but this just soaks right in its lasted for a while but and then follow it is so cute so cute but yeah I really like this and it doesn't feel like anything's on your face but it really helps with a glow and does help with redness I do like this for that but yeah I really like this product
