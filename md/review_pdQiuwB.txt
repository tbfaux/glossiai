thebeautchronicles reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so next up I'm using the glossier stretch concealer that's what it looks like I use one of the light in Shades I know they threw another shade range I love this concealer for like lighter makeup days I think it's a great lightweight super creamy blendable concealer I really just Blends right into the skin and gives you a really nice finish super duty lightweight definitely lighter coverage I think this has more coverage than their skin tint but it works great all over the face I mostly use it to cover redness and pimples but it works on the under eyes as well without getting cakey or building up too much but overall it's really nice you can use your fingers you use a brush you can use a sponge by favoritest fingers cuz it's quick but yeah really really Gray
