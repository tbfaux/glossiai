skincare_obsessed_ reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I want to talk about one of my favorite lip balms that I've been using for forever now like I started buying these like a year ago and I have loved them ever since they are fantastic this one is rose rose as one of my favorites and I really want to buy a mango which is a new one I also really want them to come out with one with SPF and then I wouldn't literally not probably by any other lip balms ever because I really like these these are great only other thing that I really think compares to this is like the rosebud Salve which is a little bit cheaper a little bit sticker but I do realize I really love this lip balm so definitely recommend this product definitely a favor
