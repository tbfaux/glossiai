corsets_and_crewnecks reviews Generation G by Glossier: hey there today I'm going to tell you all about my favorite everyday lipstick glossy a Genji and like this you need formula is really sure and really Blends into the skin on your lips and it doesn't sink into fine lines and it's not too pigmented so there isn't any kicking or crumbling of pigment on your lips which is amazing for everyday wear and also because it's so light I can wear it everyday and you'll just see a flash of color rather than a very heavy matte lipstick it's perfect I love it and also because this is a cool tone based it goes really really well with the cool tones in my skin and it would look amazing on neutral skin Fades to
