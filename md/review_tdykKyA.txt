ivanalagos reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys so now I want to talk about philosophy lash slick this is their mascara I'm wearing it right now so mind you my lashes are actually pretty shorts and they sort of look amazing with this mascara I have a use many many miscarriages and I guess I can see my second-favorite after this one it would be like the Chanel inimitable mascara if that is how you pronounce it it's very similar except this one is not as dramatic and this one looks a lot more natural in this one does not Clump so if you don't like clumpy lashes if you don't like spidery lashes if you don't like you know like I don't know like fake lashes this stuff is just great it makes them look like superfan doubt it separates every single lash it is it like makes your lashes longer cuz it actually has like tiny tiny fibers that you can actually see that make your lashes longer and this stuff isn't transferred and it last all day
