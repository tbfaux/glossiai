uninspired reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hi there today I am going to be talking about the glossier skin tint which is what I'm wearing on my face right now it is like it's as a tent and I think it's smooth and blurs your face a lot I would say that is like my favorite part of it it's also extremely Dewey it is a letter coverage as well and it just perfect your face a little bit more however I would not recommend this if you're looking for full coverage or even medium this is extremely extremely natural and it looks just like skin it's also really really doing and I like that a lot
