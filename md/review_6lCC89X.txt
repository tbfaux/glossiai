alleex reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: over the past few years I've owned probably at least a dozen glossier balm.com and right now I am absolutely loving the tinted ones the ones that are used most often are very cherry and fig this formula is super emollient and moisturizer and delivers the perfect hint of color this is what the three shapes look like Swatch doubt if you haven't tried this formula out yet I highly highly recommend it
