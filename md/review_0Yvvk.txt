mariahrnorth reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: this is my review for glossier boy brow I have it in Brown and I'm going to show you the difference I brought eyebrow I got this for Christmas and was super excited about it because prior to this I just used to put eyeshadow in my eyebrows to fill them in which was fine but I like this more okay I had to use my other hand to hold my hair back but this has boy Brown and this one does not so you can tell it's more shaped it's more place and that's what I like about this as opposed to just filling in with eyeshadow obviously because it keeps my eyebrows in place all day so I'm do the other one and show you the complete and there are the Browns I would give this a 10 out of 10 I really like boy Brown
