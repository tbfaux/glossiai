sweetlittleindulgences reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: something else I've really been liking for natural makeup days is the skin tint from glass yay I am pretty pale with pink undertones and I wear the shade G10 I usually mix this with one or two drops of a facial oil just to help more evenly distribute the product across my skin the bottle actually has a squeeze top applicator so you just squeeze it right onto your skin here on the left you can see I just put a single drop of it on my hand and then to the right I put another drop of it and then blended it out over in this area where it's looking a little more smooth out and less red
