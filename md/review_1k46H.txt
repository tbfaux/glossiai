jannakrystal reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: so today I have the glossy a play vanilla clip in the shade baby so this is what it looks like this retails for about $16 this is what it looks like on and I did expect it to be a bit more vibrant and intense so yeah that is also supposed to be a high shine lacquer but I consider it to be like normal shine lacquer I don't know so this actually goes on very smooth on your lips it's not sticky at all you can build it up for more intense colorthis is as far as it goes on my lips on my skin tone I do like them to be more Vibrance so just for that I'm not buying it again but it's very good
