harmonym reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: I love you glossy a but I really hope that someday soon you guys figure out the whole search engine thing because it's maybe it's just my nap or something but it's like so screwed up like you look up one thing nothing shows up you look up another things done nothing or looking for shows up like outdated pictures I think it's because he gets it off of Amazon or likes I wish I didn't do that but there's no subcategory for the priming moisturizer rich but this is the meaning of the priming moisturizer from glossy and I like literally Barely Used it like it's still basically all full but yeah it's not that I dislike that this it's just that I wouldn't use this in the night time and I really I've sometimes I've used it a couple times in the daytime but it's just going to stick for me and the fragrance is just a little bit too much for me personally
