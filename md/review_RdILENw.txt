fourteencarrot reviews Boy Brow + Generation G Duo by Glossier: okay just sharing another and the degloss a boy brow and clear I use the glass A brow Fleck and then I go over it with the clear brow gel I'm texting another brow gel right now but I will continue to repurchase this until I try something better I would kind of be curious I don't think this has the best hold of her brow gel so if you like a super fluffy and you want them to stick up this may not have enough hold for you so I be kind of interested to test them other ones with more holes but otherwise you know I have a lot of browse to work with so this seems to work fine for me
