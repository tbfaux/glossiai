mollia716 reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: everyone so this is my luck for the spider tutorial Challenge and so I use glossier's eyeliner to make the legs and then I use color pop a white pencil to fill in my legs and then I use e.l.f. purple lipstick so I thought this would be a nice touch I don't have black lipstick so says the darkest shade I have y'all so happy Halloween and this is a lot of fun to create
