averykae reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so last but certainly not least is this gorgeous glossier balm.com I know probably everyone and their uncle has made a video about the bomb. But I finally got one and I picked out the berry just a risk cuz not many colors look good on me but I'm wearing it right now and as you can see kind of cute like it's super hydrating which of the problems my lips get dry super easily and I just think that the color is gorgeous and everyone that has borrowed this has its looked beautiful on and it smells amazing it taste like candy and I would recommend this to anyone whose lips are dry so lipstick doesn't work for them or just wants a fun little way to treat them self and anything by Basia isn't
