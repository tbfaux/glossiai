makeupbyaya reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys so my favorite mascara as of the moment is the L'Oreal lash Paradise that I have about for these open I don't know why but this is such a good mascara it's a dupe for Too Faced mascara which I don't actually like it's very clumpy but this one isn't obviously I am wearing false lashes today so you can't really tell how they look on my upper lashes but I used it on my lower lashes anyways I love this mascara so much and it's only like nine bucks at the drugstore
