pergoddess reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: so the last thing I was saying about the clothes here bubble wrap is so far I've had no problems with it it's really hydrating I don't know if it's just me but most eye cream like what's up with someone before bed and I lay down they start to make me tears I feel like the product is going in my eye but with that one I don't really get that problem so I've been living in so far as to make amount of product for the praise and yeah I don't know how much I care for it being on the lips but as far as the eye cream is definitely went for me and I don't think I'll probably we purchase it because I've tried other eye creams that are more effective as far as brightening and things like that but to have it in to finish it I'm going to definitely finish it and I can't say anything bad about it
