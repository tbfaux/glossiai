kendrae reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: he's ruined so I wanted to talk about my favorite deals that are going on and what's a little late for some of them but glossy a is actually having their deals till through Monday and its 25% off everything in like 35% offsets I think so that's a super good deal so this is the bomb.com in Wild fig and this has been my favorite one I've tried I have the birthday cake coconut Cherry in birthday cake and mango I said birthday cake twice but this isn't the most moisturizing and it leaves it lasts the longest and it also has a subtle tint it's like red but it doesn't really leave anything on the lips cuz my lips are kind of this color but I really really like this one and I love the scent and taste obviously so I just think these are really good stocking stuffer or really good gift for younger girls like me so yeah definitely recommend
