kelseylynne reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: so this is a glossy a bubble wrap I am lip Plumping cream I've been using this for about two months now and I actually really liked it I was pleasantly surprised by this product the first off we love the packaging in the little pump tip that comes on the bottle and so I just pump about half a pump onto my ring finger and then apply under my eye this is definitely a good product to use like midday if you need a little wake up under the eye you're not wearing makeup it goes on really light I like to leave it a little thicker under the eye and let it soak in overtime I just think it gives a better effect use excess on my lips it doesn't get rid of dark circles but it definitely plums that under eye so you're looking for something like that I'd recommend trying this out
