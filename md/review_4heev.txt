discobeautie reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: so I've been using the body hero daily perfecting cream for a little bit then and it makes me have a good floral scent but not like a traditional like Bath & Body floor with my natural would like a little bit of an orange juice but it's very light creamy and so I usually just put it on before bed and then it'll be good for like overnight cuz it's really sick I wouldn't want to put it on like before putting clothes on just because I feel like it gets really fix oh but I've been liking it so far I don't know if you / it again just cuz it is a little expensive I'd like you could buy or something more generic and it would have the same effect like moisturizing but you wouldn't get the smell like the glossy I smell so
