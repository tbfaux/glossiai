JayciNicole reviews Futuredew by Glossier: another glossier product I wanted to review this was also super new this is called the future do that alright so this is an oil serum hybrid and it's meant to be worn kind of like all day to give you a really nice Dewey Klaus I'll put it on really fast so here's that has a pump and they say to use two pumps I only did half my face for now just to show you the difference the side obviously doesn't have it and this side obviously it does so it makes you super Dewey it's so pretty and it feels amazing I didn't think I would want this but I went to the glossy Austin's pop up and I'm obsessed so I have it on all of my face now but I'm absolutely obsessed with this I love wearing it under my makeup cuz my face is so dry and it doesn't interfere with my makeup it actually helps
