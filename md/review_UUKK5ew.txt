LynnRose reviews Generation G by Glossier: Pacific glossier generation G lipstick in the color Leo it's a mob Brown I have it on my lips right now and it leaves like a blotted down matte finish it doesn't necessarily try down but it's very comfortable to wear on the lips and you can build this up or you can wear it more sheer does he see a lot of people's favorites and I can see why it's very comfortable and I like that it's like a your lips but better color and I've been wearing this every day it's definitely a holy grail and I will definitely repurchase this if I run out
