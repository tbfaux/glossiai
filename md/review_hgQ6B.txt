paugzzf reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I can use in this for one or two weeks and I've been liking it so far so good even though I thought it was going to be much more hydrating that actually gets a job done very very good I love the sense of this one and I love bite doesn't have any color and what I also like is it you can also apply done any other dry areas and not only on your lips so I have to say I would totally recommend this friend
