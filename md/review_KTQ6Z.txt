kendrae reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hurry I change positions for this one but I needed a better lighting for this one so I put this in and I think I should have got the blonde but I got the clear just cuz I was a little scared of if the blond was going to match my eyebrows or not but I have an eyebrow pencil so that should be fine I hope they work out together other than that I don't know how much it does actually surprised how small this is for what I thought it was but I guess it's all right like I might not use the cloud paint and beam we're going to test it out so are is Weis watched it and I put it on but my cheeks are so red because of pigmentation is
