glossycharms reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey guys so today we're going to be talking about my favorite concealer ever be glossy stretch stretch concealer is the only use is how natural looking at is I truly do think it looks more like a second layer of skin rather than a concealer it is very hydrating and it is very very Dewey I don't like about the concealer it doesn't have a lot of coverage so it doesn't really cover my red spots or any of my blemishes which have a lot of but it is extremely buildable which is super helpful however I feel like if you have oily skin I feel like this isn't the best product for you since it is an oily face another thing I love about glossy stretch concealer is the fact that it doesn't crease tell me a tall glass e stretch concealer is a product every girl should have to feel confident in your own skin
