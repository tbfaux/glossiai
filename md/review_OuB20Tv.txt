beautybymonamarie reviews Haloscope by Glossier: to finish up my complexion for my everyday makeup I'm using two more of my favorite products from glossier a the storm cloud paint and the Halo scope and moonstone I do like a little bit of a wild blush so I go ham with this but you know to each their own I just love how easily this Blends out and it's so so seamless the Halo scope does take a little time to warm up with your fingertips but I love this kind of highlighter it's really moisturizing it's not glittery just gives a really nice do we shine beautiful finish off with a little glossy lip gloss that shine is so reflective I just really aim for a natural healthy looking complexion that makes me look and feel good
