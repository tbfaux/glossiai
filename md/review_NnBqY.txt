skincare_obsessed_ reviews Colorslide by Glossier: another product I pick up from glossier play was the color slide liners and I got the dish in shade early girl and it's like a light teal color and I really like how it looks I think it really looks good with my blue eyes I really love how it kind of makes some pop I'm really glad I picked this up so I think this is really cute color and I'm really excited to see how this wears and to fully test it out
