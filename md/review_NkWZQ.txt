amudaus reviews You, Solid Perfume by Glossier: hey what's up guys it's today I'm going to be reviewing the Lost yay you perfume in the solid form so I really like glossy products and I wanted to try their perfume so I ended up getting the solid just because I didn't want to come into the whole $60 bottle so I ended up going for this solid and it's only $22 so this perfume is a floral perfumes very early and I feel like this one is like whenever I want to be really elegant and mature I use this perfume I feel like a lady what I'm using this I don't know I just feel like a mature woman using the sense that honestly I just want to keep on smelling it
