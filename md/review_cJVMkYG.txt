susiebenitez reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: so I just purchase the glassy I play vanilla clip which has also taken the interest of someone else so I've unboxed it which yes he is playing with and this is actually my second time purchasing because I loved the first one so much this is the shade blow up it's kind of a pink color and I will demonstrate it for you here's the untouched applicator before I pump it out from the bottom the really nice Pinkie color and the tip is really nice for like getting the edges I love how it wears down and I also really love the smell it's like a fruity Berry almost kind of smell so really nice
