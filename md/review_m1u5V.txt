missylissy reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to be reviewing the glossier lidstar in the shade slip I've been using it every day and I really do enjoy it for a natural look at a very subtle Shimmer however some may think that it's barely noticeable and not worth the money this is it close up it's a very pretty shade and includes 4.5 mL of product this is it's washed my hands like I said it's very natural but still very pretty I do feel like if you're a darker skin tone than me it wouldn't show very much it's still barely shows on my skin so I apply it with the applicator and then I blend it out with my fingertips I do think it's pretty but I'm not sure if I would repurchase or recommend just because I know that there are better dudes out there one of them is just elf liquid eyeshadow it's very similar in a lot cheaper
