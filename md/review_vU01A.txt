amudaus reviews Wowder by Glossier: hey what's up you guys had today I'm going to be reviewing the glassy water and I have two routers they're both in different shades though this one is a lighter shade is G11 and g12 and this one is g82 G10 this is the lighter shade I really like this under my eyes in the middle of my forehead and on my chin this is the darker shade that I have G2G 10 and I used all over my face because this is the color I have in the skintint so uses powder so I really like this proud I'm going to open one up to show you it has this little netting inside so when you open it whole bunch of powder it doesn't fly up which I have a problem with almost all the powders that I have I love that it has that little netting I really looks powdery reduces all the shininess and just leaves my skin really Dewey and nice doesn't look too matte or dry
