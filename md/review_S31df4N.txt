kelseysusino reviews Body Hero Daily Oil Wash by Glossier: okay so very quickly wanted to review this glossier body wash body wash and annoying but my friend Carrie Teresa where she's on here she's the one that got me on here I told me to buy this and I did and obviously should always listen to Carrie because this is amazing I love it smells so good the glossy a classic sign is just so nice and I also got the lotion which I'm still waiting for but then there's this other body oil as well but I'll fill you in as I guess but this is so great and I heard that the body oils clean better than normal like body wash because those don't really penetrate like this really penetrates and like really cleans and like make you smell really good but it's super easy to use
