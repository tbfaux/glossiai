styleitwithsofia reviews Haloscope by Glossier: how does it appear from Silas Sophie on Instagram and this would be my last tutorial for today but same as you guys how I apply my glossier haloscope in the street of court so I take it off when I put it up a little bit look at my little beat him here and I do one line and go across kind of like a backwards L then what I'll do is I'll run it out with my fingers for about a minute just to make it look a little more natural if I were playing this on top of foundation which I usually normally do not do that but I would rub it on my hands like that and then apply but I usually just do directly to the face because I don't really have any foundation on just concealer so yeah this is the glove that we're looking for and yeah slide my beauty blender or a brush so yeah
