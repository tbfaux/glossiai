nevibaby reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: this is definitely my makeup Holy Grail the Cynthia glossier stretch concealer in the shade G11 so as you can tell I'm like really tired and haven't been sleeping well and so this stuff makes my under eyes vanish like but it's so smooth and like soft and it doesn't feel like you're wearing a lot which is like my favorite thing also very buildable and yeah so I can't live without this concealer and I can't wait to run out so I can buy another one so I just finished doing the rest of my problem areas and it just doesn't really look like I'm wearing anything I could just looks like my face just probably my favorite thing about this concealer it looks like you and it doesn't look so it's another approved for sure
