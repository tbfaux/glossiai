riyahtaylor reviews Super Pure by Glossier: glossier super pure so I think I've done a review on all my favorite serums except for this one because this one's currently out of stock and I'm sad because they don't know when they'll be restocking them but this was my jam for such a long time but at least you guys see my empties of this it's crazy because my skin literally relied on this at one point Mt obviously a big key ingredient in this is niacinamide this just really help to keep my skin balance like it would help prevent breakouts and if it was like a time of the month and I did have a breakout it would really help to reduce redness and just literally just disappear disappear for my face it had a super thin consistency almost like water but my skin just soaked it up and it just worked and I'm really sad I hope that they were stopped this because my skin is needing it
