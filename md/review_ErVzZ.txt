Bmak0324 reviews Solution by Glossier: hi guys so now that I'm actually doing this I feel like I might have already done a maybe a first impression review on glossy skin solution but I can't really remember feel free to go back and check but I am here to give an update or I'm here to just give my overall impression if I haven't done one before but like I said this is glossy a solution and exfoliating skin perfector as 10% aha BHA PHA salicylic acid acne treatment this is not really work for my skin I find that it is really break me out I just leave the texture on my skin a little weird but it does really help with my chest acne which I read other views that people have a similar experience that doesn't work great for their face but it works really great on their chest therefore I'm definitely going to keep using this product when I do have their random breakout on my chest otherwise it's just too harsh for my face but yeah
