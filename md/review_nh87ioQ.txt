missylissy reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hi guys so I went to the glossy a store in Manhattan today and I saw this and I just couldn't resist like it doesn't capture on camera like how pretty this is this is a holographic shade of the glossy lip gloss and it just has a ton of Shimmer in the store it looks pink but here it kind of looks like yellowish gold but either way when you put on your lips you can relate all fight on it is beautiful so I'll just show you right now and it looks like I guess you can tell like in this lighting going in the right lighting you can definitely see it but like from afar it just looks really nice and glossy and I really do enjoy like the type of gloss it's like a nice thick laws that I could tell us going to stay on my lips it's going to keep them hydrated and yeah I really enjoyed it so far
