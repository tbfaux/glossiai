pergoddess reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so in addition to the concealer I also got the glossier lip gloss in The Red Tent so I'm going to open it up and show your colors look agency I ever had the original one and I bodied it I don't know why I can't seem to throw this package away with it so as you can see it's like a red tent it reminds me of like the old school Tammy Taylor affect like with a French manicure but when it goes on it doesn't really leave a drastic drastic read you but it does give you that nice like you just had a sucker and kind of vibe so my first impression so far eyes I like it have to wear for a few days to give a full of you so stay tuned for that
