butterandbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: all right now this is Puff this is a late cool pink I think because the other shades are ones that are not as it looks like a pretty common color I have it went out here and this is a bit more opaque like this is a fairly common blush or a lip shade so it doesn't excite me it's good I just don't I think of all the other one isn't as exceptional or rather I don't mean less upset exceptional it just like less remarkable maybe it's a better word like for me personally that's just doesn't really do that much I have seen other people at when it was really nice and I do like it's a beam of a nice as a Nightshade so that's the sky which is coming up next so yeah that's it I just think of all the colors like a simple cool tank is not very exciting
