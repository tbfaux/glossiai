thechicmachine reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: alright y'all review of the day I just finished my mini size glossier priming moisturizer Rich this is actually my second jar of this I had it in a full-size jar about a year-and-a-half ago that I completely finished it's been awhile since I've used this I am not a fan of this stuff it's a nice thick moisturizer but if you have oily skin at all you will feel like a complete and total oil slick grease spot just disgusting and if you don't like fragrances and I do like fragrances but this is a very very very strong lavender scent and that's not what I want to put on my face at night that's not what I want to put on my face during the day like it's too close to my eyes and make my eyes water so personally I would find like a literally any other thick moisturizer to use
