madierb reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: okay so here we have the glossier lip gloss just the rag Euler original one it's very nice I do like it packaging is really pretty although for a lip gloss I don't find it to be amazing it is definitely nice I'm wearing it right now but there's nothing there's nothing special about it and it is a little more expensive so it's not completely budget-friendly for those who like I don't know but it's definitely not like drugstore prize so for it just not being anything special I wouldn't 100% recommend it is nice that this film is an ellipse not very sticky is good but there are other the glasses that you can buy that are just as good
