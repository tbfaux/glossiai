abooogie_ reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: and I prefer thin skin tint and this is in the shade G9 is just one of the new released at glassy a recently made with all the new shades and this is a warm medium tone and I did want to swap it for you guys have never used it before so it'll be a first impression to the instructions that says shake it well it's already Shook and then the applicators like this which is so nice so I do want to go ahead just it says you can apply it with your fingers
