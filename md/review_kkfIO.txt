mzudsiri reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: couple days ago I picked up the berry bomb.com from class C A I already own two of the other flavors I have mango and I have coconut I actually used to own the Cherry which is why I was really excited to see this one because I actually didn't keep Cherry for very long I gave it away I didn't like the scent I didn't think the color really showed up at all this one that color shows up a little bit better for me but sadly it's not really like the pictures on their website I would suggest if you want something kind of more like a real tint I would mix the generation G lipstick in jam with the berry bomb.com if you don't all really like a semi matte finish but personally I really like the lipstick on its own so what I say get the berries you have some of the other ones maybe not but if you still really like Barry and you just want a tiny wash of color in your lips are paler than mine I would suggest trying it
