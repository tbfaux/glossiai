emilymak reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so it's not going to tell you what I think about the glossy a mango balm.com Universal skin Salve as 0.5 fluid ounce and or 15 mL milk this and I love the packaging a lot and I also love the product a lot I got this from one of my friends my birthday like few years ago for like last year and I haven't used it much to be honest cuz of other things I'm using I do really like it the scent is amazing smells like mango obviously and the texture is also really good it's like it's it's like thicker than a normal gloss I would like normal lip balm I would say but it's not too thick it's really good it can be used for keeping use on your lips on cuticles on elbows on your friend anywhere that needs some love so I can really be used anywhere anywhere by Lexi's on my lips
