zameena reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: everybody so these are the glossy a cloud paint brushes they are some of my favorite blushes and I last a super long time so today I'm going to use the shade Dusk to hear it is I know some people put it on there on the back of their hands to help buff it out but I know how much I want and I know I've learned how to control this blush just allows for a really like natural looking flush color I have mirrors all around me feels by briefly looked but anyways that's that shade if you're interested in seeing what these look like definitely let me know but super simple look I know these are often complained about for how much they gush out but you just have to learn how much to use at
