eri_chikusa reviews Futuredew by Glossier: Samuel review go see a future do this is oil serum hybrid but I don't really use as a skin care product or serum as a serum just cuz like I don't really need to know why I'm going to give this one right and then I use this one as a highlighter so you just got to have a tiny little clicks instead of a pump and then you just going to put it on top of the high points of the face I have it already so I'm going to put it anymore but it really gives you a natural like it's not like I'm trying to highlight those stuff but like it's more subtle like I'm just your like me today I don't know what kinds of give you a dewy look and it's really like sink into your skin so it's a really natural
