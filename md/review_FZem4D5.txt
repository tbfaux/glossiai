katie- reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi this is Henry doing this review but it's over an update review of the glossier balm.com originally I just had the rose when I made my first impressions review and it wasn't it was a little overpriced and honestly like the basic ones like a rose I still think it is I really really enjoyed this crap when I got my T.J.Maxx which is bigger and I can I can text him or for like a basic bar and that's what like this when I was in the other like non-tinted ones I feel like but if you find the one you really really love so that I really love the scent of a birthday which is why I really love the scent and the end of the Chariots the very one I don't love the scent of it as much but those two I would definitely be oh my gosh definitely reorder againthis one it's nice but again I think it's a little too basic to be paying $14 to 4:13 so I was that are amazing but there is some like you can get soap
