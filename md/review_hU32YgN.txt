macyjy reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: and honestly smells like jasmine tea and flowers I've already used it it's like super creamy it's kind of like oil-based so it like emulsifies all so it looks like this kind of oily and then when she rub it around it kind of like Frank milky and queen I only like body wash that much because they like the smell doesn't stay on your skin but this one definitely did when I used it yesterday for like most of the day and I love it
