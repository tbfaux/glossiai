skinrecharged reviews You, Solid Perfume by Glossier: hey guys it's the day I'm going to be reviewing this glossy a solid perfume so this is the youth perfume as probably a lot of y'all know and basically this perfume is just a perfume in a solid form and this gorgeous heavylux packaging it basically weighs a pound probably more like a fourth of a pound but it still is quite heavy the color of it is as you can tell gorgeous to have a nice glossy finish and the actual smell of it is hey I it smells like a grandma anyway but in the best way possible if that makes sense I'm still getting used to the smell and I'm still deciding for what looks I like it with cuz I tend to base my looks off of smells and stuff like that I've had the same Taylor Swift perfume for the past 4 years so over the past week I've been doing a major search and purchase of a whole bunch of different perfumes to try out and so far I'm really liking this one it's very light and fresh but it still has a little kick to it
