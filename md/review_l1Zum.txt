abooogie_ reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: I pick up lash look at the glass A Miami store and I got to say I really love this mascara I was a little hesitant at first but when I went to the store I tried it on and I was like I think I love this alot the list on this is just really nice and subtle and it kind of just elongates her lashes but so makes it look Supernatural and just really beautiful so I'm going to just show you guys real quick change of scenery here but do you see how I just picks up all your lashes just kind of elongate send a little bit okay guys check this out this is lash slick this is no lash slick you see it still looks Supernatural but it's nice and long they're kind of fluffy and I really love it this brush is so easy to use and barely any massachu can see
