lifewcourt reviews Hand Cream by Glossier: Sasuke's hand cream I hate to start off the pack day is literally so cute like what I love the color of it like okay so what are we doing my first impressions of this hand cream with you like I said the packaging is super kill it smells amazing elderly smells exactly like their perfume so yeah like I said it's exactly their perfume it does smell kind of strong no one sits on if you don't like strong sense I wouldn't recommend it for you after rubbing it and I find like it feels very thin and does not have oily at all like you can definitely tell it's hydrating though even though it's thin which I really like
