lonnekemckinney reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hello I'm going to be reviewing the glossier birthday balm.com one of the biggest complaints I hear is about the packaging that the holographic glitter comes off and it has started to come off on the sides I've had this for about a month but it doesn't get on my hands or anything like that or in my bag so that's all I really care about but I just try to squeeze it from like this part and not up there and I but this color is clear with a holographic a small amount of holographic glitter in it but it's definitely noticeable especially if you're out in the sun but I personally really liked it The Taste is also very like frosting like or like vanilla I guess you could describe it but yeah I really like this one
