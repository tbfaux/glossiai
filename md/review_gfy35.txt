courtneyy reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so this is going to be a first impressions video on the tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour blush and quirky I absolutely love the way this is pressed in here and it doesn't really show on carrots more of an orange a bush and I made it on for the high points of my cheeks so I think it's pretty cute I'm usually more of a cloud paint lover that's the only watch that I used but this is give it to me so I thought I would try it out and I think it's pretty cute I like the color it looks like glass see a cloud paint in the end I'm being actually and I don't so it's very subtle and natural-looking and I think that I'll keep using it
