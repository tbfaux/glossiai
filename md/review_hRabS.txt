_emilymarie reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys so in the next couple of reviews I'm going to share my nighttime skincare routine through review so obviously the first thing I do is cleanse my face I use the glossier Milky jelly cleanser because it just does like the best job and it's not irritating my skin never feels dry after I use this and it gets all my eye makeup off without like making that film over my eyes I just never irritates my skin or my eyes it's really nice I even have a little baby one which is great for traveling and yeah this is just really gentle I'm really excited to try the new oil makeup remover that they just released and I actually just bought it with my super great coins cuz it's a reward right now so I'd really recommend trying that out the I love this the price is greatlike I've had it for a long not a long time but I'd like it's just a last a long time you know cuz you don't need a lot and the pump is just really easy to use so
