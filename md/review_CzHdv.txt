Lai2ly reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: this is what the new vanilla clip from glossy play and it is so freaking gorgeous I love it you only know that you only need a little bit so cuz it does like you have a lot of pigment it is still super pillowy and smooth on the list not high-shine but it does have like a shine to it's like lipstick I guess but in a liquid formula this is the product and it looks so nice on the lip to have it on right now and it's super gorgeous the shade of everything about it this is what it looks like it is super pretty I only put a little bit but if you want like more color payoff you can definitely do that and it is so gorgeous
