lifewcourt reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: glossier stretch concealer I currently use the shade g12 which I believe is their lightest shade I could be wrong but this is a perfect match for my skin tone this is my go-to concealer for like those no makeup makeup days I like to use it as like a complete base actually and then just like blend it out as like a faux Foundation look kind of thing as you can see I've literally had the bottom of this I use it all the time formula. Creamy do we I really like Elsa Thomas can I feel like if your oily or you might not like it I'm not dry I'm combo but I really enjoy this
