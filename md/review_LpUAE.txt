glittercrocs reviews Blade Sharpener by Glossier: this is the glossy play sharpener I picked this sharpener up because I didn't have a sharpener to sharpen the glossy Play Colors lights that I have bought and I figured I would just pick this one up since it's from the same brand it actually worked really good for my eyeliners and also it works great for lip liners that are really soft and everything that I enjoy about it is that it came with this little pencil would you can sharpen and it'll actually clean the sharpener so that it doesn't get all messy and that the product don't get on the other pencils that you end up sharpening Prince sample I'm going to sharpen thiseyeliner I twisted it about one time around and now it's nice and sharpened and it didn't break
