mel04 reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hi everybody so I will be showing you guys the Milky jelly cleanser and giving my honest review I would give it a 8 out of 10 because it's a good cleanser but I do have kind of two problems with it so it kind of made me break out around here which is fine for me because it's not that like crazy and I have treatments that I'm using which I will show in the next to the videos but it has a tacky feeling but I still like the cleanser like not for the tacky feeling but for what it does after it makes your skin feel really soft afterwards but before you wash it you will get a tacky feeling so and that is my honest reviewwould I buy it again maybe maybe not depending on how I feel over a. Of time 8 out of 10 thank you guys so much for watching
