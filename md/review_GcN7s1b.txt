adrienne_carpenter reviews Skywash by Glossier: hi this is my first time first video I am actually reviewing the glassy Sky wash which I got in Palm I was really excited to try this product because I'm not super into a lot of makeup so like it's gives a really really really nice color on the lid and I find it super super user-friendly I find the super super is super super light in terms of it actually is just to wash but luckily I actually have another yellow that pretty match or matches it pretty well and pop of color in the inside but I think it looks pretty good
