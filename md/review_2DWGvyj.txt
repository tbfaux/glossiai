yolk reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay made a video yesterday on the cloud paint but then I deleted it because my swollen lip was really swollen and it did not look good but it looks good today so let's make this video again okay for contacts I have not use cloud paint since its first came out many years ago and the color I had back bad was dusk but today I decided to do a berry color and this is when I grab from The Witches Eve and I'm just going to go ahead and do it on my face I barely squeeze the tube and this is already so much products like this is going to last me forever also I hate the cap it hurts my hands to open okay this is what the color looks on me I like it so much more Blended in with a beauty blender I just like how natural it looks on me but is it worth it not really
