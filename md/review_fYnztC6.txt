hqutie reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: today I want to show you guys the glassy a cloud paint in the shade spark this is the one that I found is most flattering on my skin tone and it looks beautiful and time of year for fault I'm in love with the packaging I think it's so adorable and all the glasses products have such amazing packaging so when you open it you do have to be a little careful because it's squeezed out and less is more with the product so and usually just dab a little bit on my finger and then I make little dots on my face like that so I'm to have my little Dodge I just picked up at it init's a liquid Cream Blush so less is definitely more you could always add more so don't go crazy as you can see you could do that very natural blush look I love bring it up here to get that's fun cuz love even in the winter
