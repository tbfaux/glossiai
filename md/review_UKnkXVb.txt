virginiac reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so I'm going to be reviewing glasses Cloud paint and the shade that I'm reviewing is dusk I normally really like lessees Cloud paint because it's not expensive it's easy to apply and a little bit of product goes wrong way but for this product I didn't really like it because the color was kind of orange e in a distant go well with my skin tone like I feel like a pinkish color would have gone better so I'm just going to watch the man so you can see what it looks like so that's what it looks like as you can see it's like a brownish coloroverall I really did like the product is really easy to apply and it's pretty affordable but I just wouldn't recommend that shade so yeah
