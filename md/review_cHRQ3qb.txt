krystal_ reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys so I'm going to review the cloud paint glossier this isn't the color of puff I really recommend has if you're looking for like a natural look at the end of the day and you'd want to put too much makeup on this feels weightless like you're not wearing anything and it's a little bit goes a long way for sure I've had this for a long time and it I still have a bunch left you just been a little bit on your hand then you put a little bit and you can rub it in I recommend with your fingers because on a brush it'll just stay on the brush rather than on your face but honestly I love this product so much everyday for like a natural look
