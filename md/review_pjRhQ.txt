sevillathalia reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so this is the glassy a letter in the color cop liquid eyeshadow is very long-lasting the color is kind of like a metallic rose gold and I like them if you are looking for a very glittery look this is not the eyeshadow for you but is you going to start a letter than it is I'm going to show you what it looks like so this is what it looks like I just likely type it in and yeah it's not like a blinding glow but if you want like a bottle glitter this is the I should have for you
