Bmak0324 reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hi guys here I haven't glossier lash slick I have to say when I first got this mascara I was not the biggest fan I really like a mascara that makes my eyelashes super thick and long this one definitely is more about making your eyelashes long rather than thick however one day I ran out of mascara and that this is all I had and when you really Lair the song it can make your lashes thick and I also like pairing this with other mascaras that are known to make your lashes big so for example I use the Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara and I like to put this on first kind of as a base coat really lengthen eyelashes and then I put be better than sex on on top of that and it really makes my lashes look great on the packaging is really cute it's not super expensive sorry the lighting is not that great right now butso if you got us and you didn't like it at first I really recommend giving it a second try and really learn it up on your lashes
