sarahjgomez reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: hi guys I have the glossier skin tint here it's a little bit loved as you can see I've been using this for maybe two months there and at first I didn't like it I won't lie I did not like it but now we love it and I want to show you why so this is the final product of just the glossy skin tint on my face I love it I feel like it neutralizes a little bit a little blurry but it doesn't you know I have a lot of coverage so I still feel very natural and it's really breathable and overall amazing highly recommend
