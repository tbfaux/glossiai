naomiepp reviews Super Glow by Glossier: next up is glossier super glow vitamin C serum don't like that big open my bathrooms ugly okay so this is going on after the hydraulic acid because of molecule size is my understanding I don't know any of this for sure I should know because science is my academic Fields but I don't really look these things up if they work in my skin is getting better and it's not making my skin worse at end of all of them so it my understandingis due to molecule size have a lot of gas at first and then you can follow up with treatment so I'm using the glossier super glow like I just said there's not that much and then I'll put it all over my face and I know technically you're not so slow these drivers like touch your face because of bacterial whatever but I'm going to use this fast enough that for the amount of time it would take to grow a culture in here it's not going to make much of a difference okay
