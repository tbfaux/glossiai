devinkielle reviews Hand Cream by Glossier: so glossy set me a hand cream so thank you la ca for one of the hand creams is also able to get someone to somebody so that was great but hand cream smells like glossy you but a floral musty version when you first apply it it's not the most Pleasant sent to me but I get that sometimes it's part of your illusion II but it where is why I like once it settles it smells beautiful it's like a pressure cleaner version of glass CAU I still haven't been able to do the one hand open thing that they say the bottle is designed for but the packaging super cute outfits in everything and I love it it doesn't make your hands greasy and I'm going to show you the texture so this is a texture it's rubs in a little bit but it doesn't make you greasy and it's pretty lightweight
