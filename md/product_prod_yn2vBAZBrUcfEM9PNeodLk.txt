Glitter Gelée by Glossier: Everything about Glitter Gelée is feel-good: add this one-step glitter gel anywhere you want a jeweled effect. The multi-dimensional paillettes mirror everything as you move, changing and reflecting color everywhere you look. Comfortable, wearable, and long-lasting, thanks to a transparent gel base, this is an instant mood boost that stays shiny and stays put for 12 hours. No fall out, no flaking. No matter how you choose to wear it—whether it’s a sweep all over the eyelids or a dab near the corners of the eye—Glitter Gelée gives you a look that stands alone.
How to use: Use fingertips or for more precision, use The Detailer to place onto skin. To remove, use a cotton pad and Milky Oil. Avoid washing off with water to prevent getting glitter into the waterways. Not safe for lips or lip area.
