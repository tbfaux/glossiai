ashley2005 reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: Kaiser Gates of the next president going to talk about is the glossier Lash slick mascara I've been really liking this mascara recently because it's really not full and it doesn't get as much left but it does give volume and its really good for that like an hour to a day when you want to do a simple makeup look and I've been really liking those like simple cute soft makeup looks so this is perfect and that and this would be great for anyone that also wants to do that kind of luck which is why I've been so he liking it andI got it off of glasses websites but I have visited the store and they have a great display in Manhattan and I just totally recommend this product if you're going for that soft cute simple makeup look
