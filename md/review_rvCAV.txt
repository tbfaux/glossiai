Lai2ly reviews Niteshine by Glossier: this is the night shine in pale Pearl and it is super pretty it is super subtle but it's also like super reflective break I forgot oh yeah this is the size of it and it's super cute and everything right but then I don't know how much it is like 20 bucks you get money from milk makeup and this is like 24OMG but it is super pretty and I will show you guys doing that and I've got it right here and here it's like very be me and like reflective it's got any big chunks of glitter like super small literally how it looks like in the bottle I would never purchase it again but I do really like it right here in the inner Corners it's okay
