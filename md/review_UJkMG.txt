kylieon09 reviews Lidstar by Glossier: I'm going to be giving my honest review on the lid star from glaciere in the shade Cub this cream like eyeshadow from glassy are like this like Rosie got kind of rose gold pinky color which I'm obsessed with I literally like use it everyday like it's up to you if you choose like kind of like like warm like if you like we're warm like eyeshadowthis is hits washed on my hand literally just like one swipe and full coverage this like also like we have problem with it is like a lot of Pet Cremations like they smudge the powder eyeshadow but this doesn't do it like I literally like his perfect spies on smoothie looked perfect swimming with only this so I totally recommend that you buy this like it's a must-have
