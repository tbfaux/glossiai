malaina reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: okay for my first video I wanted to do the floss see a brown flick and brown because I think it's a lot of hate in the community I like people say it dries out quick or it doesn't perform is it says I personally think it's one of my favorite brow products I'll go ahead and demonstrate with one brow okay so as you can see like this is the brow that's done in this one's not obviously it's not my definition and I filled in any sparse areas I don't use it all over the entire brow just as far as spots but I've had mine for literally months and it's still very pigmented and it works great for me and then I just finished with boy browand like another thing is is like with glossy a you're not really trying to achieve anything like super different Oreo Glam I think this product has personally really slept on I love it and I'm going to repurchase
