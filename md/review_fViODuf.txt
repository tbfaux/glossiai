ayyoitslo reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: I love the island I like that it's doesn't so much do to me always wanting to wipe my eyes like during the day cuz I forget our makeup all the time on the skinny tube allows me to really maneuver with the cat eye because sometimes the right might be a little skinnier or elongating alone might be a little more chunky reading on my leg so I like that I can just maneuver with it and it was really good for likeand I'm not chunky fingers but average size fingers on a whole small fingers cuz my little sister uses it too so yeah it's great
