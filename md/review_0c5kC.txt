harmonym reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: okay guys today I'm back with yet another thing from glasses that I'm reviewing however I'm like literally everything all their lot a product this is one that I just kind of have some mixed feelings on this is about a stick and basically it is a kind of pain like stick where you screw up the bass and you place it on any. Of acne and pimples anything of the sort it has a metal tip rollerball which is really soothing and I do like that about this if feels very Cooling and calming on any of my pimples and the power comes out of kind of four different quarters on the ball the one thing that I don't think that it's crazy convenient I love the packaging I love the way that it comes out I would love the way it looks but honestly I just don't know if it's the best treatment for acne I tend to like my Mario badescu drying lotion Lil Bit better and think it does a little bit of a better job not discounting
