mimiwikiki reviews Balm Dotcom, Mango by Glossier: we're going to be trying out Domingo bomb.com I'm a package like packaging gets me misses so aesthetically pleasing packaging I love the color scheme on the plastic can kind of be bent which is really nice so you can finish up everything up it's like a toothpaste tube price so like I said if this is the mango it does have a slight Peach eaten it said and see if this is yeah it's kind of a Rosy it smells like something I would put on my body I tried to remove all the lipstick I had but oh my goodness wow it is melting it smells really nice I know the exact smell it smells a little bit like this mango lotion from Sephora otherwise it melts right into your lives and holy cow is moisturizing and then this formula is very good but the only thing is just a stupid price for it like $15 for a volume
