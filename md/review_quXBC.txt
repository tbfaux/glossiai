harmonym reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: so I made this for real and then I got deleted all the story I'm going to be reviewing at three different glossy eye products on First Impressions for this one and then just kind of like a talking about the product and like packaging review out now for the second to because I just got a birthday present for my beautiful amazing best friend who decided to get me some positive stuff so anyways this is glass a bubble wrap it is an eye and lip Plumping cream I have actually applied this time I've actually given it some time to drive down a little bit to shine has cut a little bit but I still I really feel like my eyes are really moisturize I really like it not the biggest fan on the lips I think it needs like a lip balm on top of it but I think it's would be really nice and hydrating for underneath your concealer or foundation and to make your skin look really nice and Chloe
