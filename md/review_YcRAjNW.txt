sarah_novio reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: recently I redeem to the fracking cheek slime and it's a shade Fielding what I like is its little applicator and it keeps it really needs and it's this really cute orange e-collar so it really makes it easy to create that sunburn look this does remind me to go see Cloud paint as it is a liquid blush but this is less pigmented than that so if you have a heavy hand this is really great for that and they're also the same price so they're kind of not really any different from each other but it is a great option
