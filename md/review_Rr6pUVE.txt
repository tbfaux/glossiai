fourteencarrot reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: okay I've finished my first glossier's that stick I had this one kind of a long time I think they launched it last year so I've had it for a while and I would put it on whatever breakouts I had so I think that's a pretty good lasting power for a little stick like this you know they can't hold it very much product I already ordered a new one because I've been breaking out more with my mask and I do think this is the perfect kind of thing to put in your purse and you know apply right when you feel the zit coming on I think it does help reduce the size of the debt over time I don't think it's super they kind of advertisement like you can put makeup over it I don't think so I think it's just better as a spot treatment under your mask or overnight but I already ordered a new one
