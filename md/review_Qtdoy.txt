hannahbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so this is the whipped souffle lip and cheek color from Nicks and I think that this is a really nice and expensive little drugstore products that is a really fun thing to try out especially if you're kind of feeling tempted by the glossy a cloud pains or you just want to try out a liquid blush for the first time this has worked pretty well for me so I have it in the shade pink Cloud which is this really really pretty bright pink and Miss does blend out so you can make it quite sure I'm wearing it as a blush tonight actually and I'm also wearing it on my lips a little bit more like later on and thicker so I really think it Blends out nicely it's a little bit thicker than the cloud pants from glassy and it is pretty heavily fragranced I think it has the same kind of vanilla scent as their lip creams do actually but I find that it Blends out very easily and innocently fashion to the glossier cloud paint so I think that this is a really nice little handy thing for travel I think it works well and it's an expensive so they did a good job
