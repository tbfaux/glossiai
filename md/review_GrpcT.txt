MelissaOrons reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: All rights reviewing one of my favorite things glossier boy brow and I wear the shade of brown set my browser just kind of do their own thing hard to control but boy brows like a Pomade where you can make your brows look thicker fuller and darker without canceling them in which I don't like this is much easier to use and last all day but with a difference he hold the finished brows what's also really good about this product is that if you have patchy spots in your eyebrows which I do instead of drawing them in the Palm I just kind of magically finds where it's supposed to be so it's really really easy to use
