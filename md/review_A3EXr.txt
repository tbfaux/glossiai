sweetlittleindulgences reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: classiest boy brow is the one makeup product that I use every single day no matter what like even if I'm not leaving the house I will put on some boy brow to tame my face so the wand is really tiny it's got this teeny tiny little spoolie on the end the product itself is actually really tiny as you can tell I will say that's the only downside to this product is that I feel like it's not worth the price per ounce but overall I'm going to keep purchasing it because it holds my brows in place so well and it gives me the perfect amount of tint you can use it on its own or with a little bit of brow pencil underneath for more dramatic look I love this and will continue to repurchase
