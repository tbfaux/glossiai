legallyobsessedwithmakeup reviews Futuredew by Glossier: fifth grade so this is what glossier futuredew looks like after I put on the rest of my makeup so it has been a few hours since I first put it on though because I got distracted by work and I can pick know the review after I was done with my makeup but I would say that there is like kind of a small but noticeable glowy difference to putting this underneath makeup it did however seem to make my makeup pill a little bit especially the primer and the the sunscreen that I put on top of it I'm not I can't say for sure that it was this but that's the only thing I changed today in my base and I don't usually get any pilling so I think it might have been this which kind of makes sense since this isn't a boil on serum hybrid so I think the oil part might have had issue for me but I think this would work really well if you were just doing after makeup without any makeup like foundation on top it would just created a really nice Glory Days
