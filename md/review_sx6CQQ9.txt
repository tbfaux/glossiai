madierb reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so I have the glassy a live star in Cub it's like a rose gold Capri bronzy color it's really pretty on the eyelids I like to wear this also for special occasion just occasions just because I don't wear much makeup normally but it looks really pretty on the eyes I usually use this little advocator at has like put it on the lake lead like right here or on like the line where you would have usually put eyeliner and then I use my finger to blend it up or our Lord is it brush or else I'll just put it likea streak in the middle of the live like right here and then blend it out because this is very like it's liquid so it's pretty strong and heavily pigmented but looks very nice on the eyes and everything and I'll show you
