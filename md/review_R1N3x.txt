gabrielarousseau reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: so I know something is important and essential and you need it but I absolutely hate sunscreen and this is literally the only sunscreen I accept and the only sunscreen I'm going to put my face I love it so much because it doesn't really smell or feel like sunscreen it's this beautiful jelly water like texture that is unlike other sunscreens and it goes on smoothly and you can't see it at all it's just completely clear I love it now my face is protected and I don't feel like I have poopy stuff on my face it's the one one
