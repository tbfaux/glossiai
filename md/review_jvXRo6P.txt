kaiaiko reviews Skywash by Glossier: hi everyone so right now I have these really cute glassy Sky watches they're out of a really really pretty they vary in their opacity this one is called Tara I'm just going to show you what it looks like on my pain or like my wrist and it will just show you how I feel I'm about to go to bed so I won't be testing them on my eyes but from here you can see that they're very very differently in capacity and transparency so it's really cool have a good day guys remember to check out glossier's really awesome Sky washes
