lilyytay reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: my skin has been breaking out a bit lately so I thought I would use one of my favorite masks and it's the glossier mega greens Galaxy Pack and it's a detoxifying face mask and it really does help to clean out your skin and just help to calm down breakouts a lot now that I've applied it I basically just let it sit until it's dry and then rinse it off I don't find it drawing for my skin at all I do have Oily to normal skin type though so if you have dry your skin maybe just use it as a spot treatment but overall this is my favorite mask to deal with breakouts and just any congestion that I might be having a really does help to clear everything up and leave my skin super-soft
