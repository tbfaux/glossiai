lilyytay reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: I thought I talked a bit about glossier Cloud paint since it's the products that started my absolute obsession with blush I love how easy it is to use you literally can't mess up since it's super easy to blend out and the colors are super pretty I have it in the shades puff Hayes and dusk puff is my favorite cuz it gives the perfect sunburned look and dust I love to use as an eyeshadow if you're someone who doesn't really like blush or doesn't know how to apply it this is the perfect product for you
