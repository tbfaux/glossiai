miarenee reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey everyone today I'm doing a review on the glossy eyelash like this by far has to be my favorite mascara ever and it is so lengthening and it looks Supernatural it does make your lashes thick but not clumpy at all like other miscarriages the packaging is all so adorable don't mind then I'm breaking out a little but this isn't my eyelashes look like without the mascara and this is what my eyelashes look like with mascara this is a mascara wand and if you can until it's really long and the bristles are really skinny so what makes your lashes first then and have a long look over or I would definitely recommend this will be the best mascara he would ever own and you should definitely go buy it
