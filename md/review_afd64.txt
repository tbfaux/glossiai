riyahtaylor reviews Super Pure by Glossier: glossier super pure so I've already done a review on the super pure but as you guys can tell it looks a little difference it is bigger and it was just reformulated and I'm just so happy that it's back this was the only thing that could regulate my like breakouts and I'm breaking out pretty bad if you guys haven't noticed which is why I've kind of been a little bit Mia but you know what whatever we all go through it and I'm just so happy that this is back here is a little side by side comparison this is the old and the newI just take maybe like a dropper full I'm just how to turn my face this is what my skin is going through at the moment it's freaking out I don't know why but just really happy about this hope it does is just as effective as it was before
