tangomango reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay the next one is going to be of the newest flavor which is the wild fig this dropped in like October maybe I don't really know I'm pretty sure is October November I love the scent of this it smells like really good I don't know what fake smile like I don't think I've ever eaten a fig but it smells very fresh and sweet the tent is a deeper kind of warranty read so if you're looking for a deeper tent I think this one would definitely be a good option I don't think I had smelled as previously but I actually really would like the scent of this and also the 10th overall I would definitely recommend this one and I love the scent and the tent
