Gabriella reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hi guys I'm going to be reviewing the glossier lip gloss it's the transparent one so it definitely Glides on really nice so you can see it had this for a while and has a velvet soft tip and I think it's a little tacky but I kind of like that Anna lip gloss I also do often put it over a matte lip gloss just so it's not so drying on my lips but I love the place that this gives and it's not that expensive so I think it's a really good cloth
