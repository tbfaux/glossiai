ferrisbeauty reviews Skywash by Glossier: I picked up several of these glassy Sky washes I think I have all shades but two of them and I really like them they are a mat wash of color that's how they're describing that's exactly the way I would say they are they just give you the list of looks like slight tinge but they are not like they're really easy to build up the most colors are at the green one and if you build it up a little bit it gets a little bit Rocky with the rest of them are really smooth and Matt and just give a little like pops your eyes they're super easy to blend and apply as well I really like them they lost a really long time to if you put on in the morning it will last all day and it won't crease or anything like that so these are definitely a winner in my book
