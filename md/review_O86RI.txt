jackyyy reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys today I wanted to review the glossier coconut balm.com but before I get started just excuse my no makeup face so anyway this lip balm I already have it on so you can kind of see like what it looks like on the lips it's a clear clear ball but it's really cool because it's like just the perfect amount of thickness wear doesn't feel heavy on your lips and like but also perfect enough sticks and it's not just like slipping and sliding around and just like comes off right away like I can put this on and be good for like a few hours also I really like that the glossier balm.com comes in like several flavors so there's probably something for you this is I don't know like my third or fourth tube the glossier balm.com I just love it
