dewyinthedesert reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys I want to talk a little bit about the glossier Lash slick the packaging first off is so cute it is this baby pink glossy a signature it is gorgeous I might just got this a little bit ago I'm usually used to wearing the Kush mascara and I am really liking this so far for an everyday mascara so I'm going to show you my lashes before and then I will show you after I put it on Sue's my lashes look like now I curl them but I don't have any product on this isn't my lashes look like after applying the mascara I love that it adds a lot of volume in the brushes kind of small so it allows you to get really close to the Lash line I think it makes a big difference and it's a really good everyday mascara
