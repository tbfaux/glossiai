tallulahhh reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so this is the glossier Lash slick mascara and I love this mascara. It's super light on my eyes and I put it on the side already but I just love how it doesn't curl your lashes together and the Rush's has a lot of little bristles on it so it really gets like every single lash which I love going to Quick put on this tie okay so I just finished the sky and I love that it doesn't make me look like I'm wearing a lot of mascara and just got to have that natural look just because it doesn't come and it's a lot thinner than other mascaras I've tried so yeah I love it
