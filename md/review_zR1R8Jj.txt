tangomango reviews Glossier set Lip Gloss and Lash Slick by Glossier: okay this is the Garcia lip gloss any color red this one it looks kind of bad on me honestly I'll show you what it looks like but it's like has a different texture than the other ones for some reason I'm not really sure why but it's like stickier and Mike more melted I'm probably cuz it like was like left out in the sun Maybe I really like it that much it looks bad on me but it'll probably look good on someone else and sex so sticky see that was kind of gross but it's just not ready for me I do like the clear one but this one is not really my color I guess so person isn't going to be a no for me but honestly it might look good on you so it depends on a c on the person
