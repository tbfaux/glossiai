amudaus reviews Glossier Soothing Face Mist by Glossier: hey guys it's today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy a soothing face mist so this is he rose water spray I really like this it smells really really nice and how it sprays it's super duper fine at evenly dispersed is everywhere however there is one thing I noticed every time I spray this around my face like I always get in my nose get at my mouth and I end up coughing so I guess that's my only one downfall but needless it smells so good I love rosewater so this smells amazing and can we just talk about the packaging I know glossy they're famous for their packaging but this looks so so pretty I love the pink aesthetic and I love how simple it is I just love coffee packaging look so so nice
