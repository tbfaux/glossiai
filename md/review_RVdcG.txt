kelseylynne reviews Generation G by Glossier: I have generation G in the shade Jam this is what the color in the stick looks like and this is how it goes on my lips I really been into this lipstick lately because it gives me a lighter Plum color to my lips which I've never found that color anywhere else and I just think it's a sweet feminine look the only thing I will have to say that I dislike about this is that can be like a little bit drying so I definitely recommend putting on the Chopstick before finishing with a gloss or bomb.com the Matt look is still really pretty but it just can get dry over the course of the day but it gets really great and really cute
