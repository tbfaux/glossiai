marcelaillustrates reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: Hi friend so today I'm going to be reviewing level up Ciara bomb.com in mango I am crazy about lip balm and I always have one in my purse I absolutely love this stuff it's so soft it's so creamy it's almost like a mango lollipop or like a mango sorbet it's super soft on the lips at Super nourishing and also if you wear it like a faker earlier at night it's almost like a live Matt so it's all the great stuff must have always keep it in my purse and that's all thank you
