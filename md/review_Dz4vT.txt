bella_shea reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: this is the last year perfecting skin tint in the shade light like I said in my last review they actually just released an entirely new shade range so this is technically the older version but it is still the same exact formula I'm wearing it now and you can see it's just very sheer coverage you can still see all of my freckles and if you were to put that just one codon even see any blemishes that you had so I liked the Sandy stretch concealer so you can really kind of build up how much coverage you do or don't want this is what it looks like just watched on my wrist
