skinisspooky reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hello my lovely today I'm going to be something that I received in the mail yesterday so it's going to be a first impressions but they are the glossier balm.com so I did the deal on glossy where you get three for 40 Canadian dollars so you end up saving five Canadian dollars and I got the coconut one the birthday cake one and the Mint one and originally the reason that I haven't tried these until now is because I thought that it was just going to be like gasoline in a tube but it turns out that the idea that I had it somewhere very wrong so I have one on my hand here and you can see it has like a nice that cancer fancy and I find that it's thicker than Vaseline so it stays on your lips watch the birthday cake 1 or smells like a really good vanilla and as you can see there's a bit of Shimmer in this one so all-in-all my first impressions are find them very moisturizing and they last on the lips really well and they don't feel sticky and gross so I would recommend
