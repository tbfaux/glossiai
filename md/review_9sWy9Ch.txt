thatgoodglow reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so if he blocked A Lash slick is a more thin brush you can see right here I wouldn't say that it is my favorite ever mascara I already have pretty naturally long and dark eyelashes so I usually look for is a volumizing mascara and the one that I really like for that is the L'Oreal fallible I don't remember don't quote me on that so this one isn't terrible especially if you want just like a little bit of length and darkening I would say that it's the best for volumizing so I don't know repurchase it especially because it's more expensive than what I usually spend on mascaras and I wouldn't say that it does what I want to anyways but you know it's gloss Gator super hyped right now so yeah it's not that it's okay
