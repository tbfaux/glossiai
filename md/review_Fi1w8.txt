kerr30 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier rose balm.com this product retails for $12 and it's just like a universal skin Salve and I usually I usually use it on my lips and it has a nice pink tint to it and it smells good even though it's subtle you can flag still smell it and then obviously smell like rose and the box it comes in is super cute except I threw it out cuz I'll text you in it looks really cute and pretty show you can see it has a little pink tint to it but it comes off pretty clear on your lips or wherever you put it but it's super moisturizing it really helps with dry lips so I've had to recommend this product
