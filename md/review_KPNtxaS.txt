KateP111 reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: super grateful today me to be reviewing the glossy lip gloss in the color red so yeah can do it so when I open it like like the applicators one of those like flat brushes quiet now you can see it really gives off like a little sheer red tint it's not is a little bit of stickiness but that's not a big deal for me how to look like doesn't feel like a stupid thick so that's great I like they give you that red color with them actually committing to an actual read a book which I love them I recommend getting the glossy lip gloss
