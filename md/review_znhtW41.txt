katieee reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay I guess I got one more thing other than my lidstar from LA CA so that is the glossier cloud paint so I really really wanted this is like the longest time and then they were having their little Black Friday think that's what it was or Cyber Monday and I remember but they will stale which was 20% off everything at least 20% of everything so I said I had to get this so I'll show you I got it in the shade beam so it's kind of like a pretty pinky kind of coralie shade I really liked it but I haven't tested it so I think I'll probably just stop you guys in the morning so check back in and I will show you guys how it works but it looks like so pretty and I'm so excited so ye let me know if you guys have products and if they're any good are you here waiting in them
