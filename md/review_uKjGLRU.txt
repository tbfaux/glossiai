annniej reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: hey guys okay I'll be reviewing the glassy a priming moisturizer Rich so this is what the product looks like I believe this one is also plastic last but it has really nice fancy packaging so this is just going to be my first impression on the moisturizer so right off the bat this is a much thicker consistency and it smells like lavender and it actually like right away it feels very velvety-smooth and right here on my nose like right here when I got out of the shower I had some dry patches and I think it took that away right now it's us a primer so I'm not really sure if you can use it like as a primer for your foundation or concealer but it does leave your face really really really smooth and soft over all of this product did feel really nice eyes skin but since this is only my first time using it I wouldn't really know too much how much
