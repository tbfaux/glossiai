Emma_mwah reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: all right guys really quick I just wanted to talk about the glossier lip gloss I got this for Christmas and this stuff is gorgeous I'm wearing right now it's really high shine and honestly it doesn't feel that heavy now it's windy where I live a lot of the time so I definitely wouldn't recommend wearing in the wind because your hair will obviously get caught but besides that it's a really gorgeous glass I got the clear one and if I put more on that's what the tip looks like Little Doe foot tip and it just goes on clear I like to wear like my rose balm.com underneath it cuz I feel like it gives it a nice pink tint that you can do it every time I don't think it dries out your lips really it's not moisturizing but I mean it's just a lip gloss and it doesn't I don't know and it stays for a while to so I definitely recommend
