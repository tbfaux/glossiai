brokegirlskin reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hello it's me hi everyone it's me if you didn't hang the glossier Milky jelly cleanser this morning this product for me has been really great I love that for you because it's a lot of what I put on my face last night's can't help it it doesn't remove a lot of that because I really feel like if I'm putting things on my skin I want them to be on there I want them just hugged in I want them do their work and so is his cleanser I love that it just kind of gives you a wash you feel really clean afterwards but you're not feeling stressed I just use it just a few minutes ago and you can see that my skin irritated or anything like that and also doesn't look stripped and dry and like thirsty and I really enjoy using this cleanser
