katmarlin reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so this is my first impression of the new shade of what one of the new shades of the Posse lip gloss I haven't tried and loved the original one so as soon as I saw the new shades drop I had to get it especially since Michelle Obama wore it had to get it by the way how cute is a tiny little pink pouch I've never seen them the size you can kind of see it compared to the gloss for reference anyway I'm going to try it outso this is me opening it for the first time oh my gosh so cute so this is what it looks like on the lips it's a nice sheer red very comfortable feels exactly the same as the original formula a plus for me
