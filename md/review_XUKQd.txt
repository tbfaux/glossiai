kate_d112 reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: I just received my first super great prize and it's the glossy is at stake and I'm super excited to try this out the box it came in is so cute Tunes little bubble wrap package and in the Box I also got a sample perfume which I already use and what actually consider getting his smells really good and it all became at these cute little stickers I literally can't get over this packaging it's so cute so it did take a little bit of twisting but I finally got the product before but I really like the rollerball applicator and my skin is pretty good right now but I am just putting in those few areas where he's a little bit of help and I will do a follow-up review on this and tell you guys how I like it
