thekristynedit reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so this mascara is a product that I have a serious love-hate relationship with so I have a huge love-hate relationship with lash slick and there's a couple reasons why so I love using it as an as an eyebrow gel that's actually the main way that uses pass little fiber so it makes my eyebrows look a little bit Fuller and it's really long lasting and it's not dark at all compared my hair so I really like that and I'm wearing it today I like to use this when I don't curl my lashes but if I do come eyelashes I find that it makes my lashes like go like like this you know so I like it because it makes my lashes look really natural and I like the way I like it the shape it gives my eyes butI don't know I don't love it as I don't know I'm indifferent about this I don't think it's worth the hype but I do like it as a brow gel so if you want a like huge module for a decent price so use it like that but if not you can pass on this
