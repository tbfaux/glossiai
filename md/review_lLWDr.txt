katie3281 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys I also have the glossier balm.com and Rose with me today that I also just got and I've tried it on before I put on the glossier lip gloss and I really really like it I was kind of looking for a substitute of wild sky looking for a substitute for the Smith's Rose balm whatever it's called and I really like this the consistency is definitely very different from that if you've ever tried it this is not sticky really like it's it's very it's like a solve item as compared to Aquaphor almost but it has a nice sense and it's like a little bit thicker but I really like it and has lots of other sense that are also probably great so I'd give it a try
