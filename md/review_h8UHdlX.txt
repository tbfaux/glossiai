ariannaa reviews Glossier You Perfume Solid fragrance compact and Glossier You eau de parfum by Glossier: it's over the weekend I went to the glossy a flagship store New York City I've never been to before to New York City and I really wanted to go to the glassies to are so I headed over there and I bought this bad boy now but I first tried it it smelled a lot like pepper to me and the lady told me oh to sprain your wrist and walk around the store and look at everything else and then smell so I did and it is completely strange smell so there is not a way for me to describe how the smells because I think it's Unique everybody I think it pulls different smells to your nose into other people's nose I wanted this for two days in a row and I've got nothing but compliments so if this is something that you're interested in buying I recommended 100% is 60 bucks for 1.7 ounces which is not a ton of product but I bought it anyways
