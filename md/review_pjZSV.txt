sona reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so I recently purchased a glossy Lids to are there really liquid glasses liquid eyeshadows for application here and the colors cub and John this is cub and this is Dawn I wanted to show you guys how they Swatch so on the right is fun sorry not gone by the way its Fawn and on the left is cup and this is them after some blending as you can see they are not pigmented at all they don't really build well but some of the color still stays and they're definitely super glittery
