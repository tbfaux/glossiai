gretchenstevens reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys I wanted to jump on here HughesNet weird intro that I do every time I want to jump on here just going to come and let you know anyway I wanted to tell you about my mascara that I love and I'm sure all of you have heard about him saying it's glassy-eyed there lash slick I just love the brush the bristles aren't super close together they have little to space which really like really allows my eyelashes to just grab onto a little bit it's not too intense doesn't make them really clogged which I love but also a trick of the trade I always have just a regular likes fooling around and I always just call my lashes after I do them the mascara is great but I really want that separated look if you like them to become together don't do this but this is a game changer as well as this
