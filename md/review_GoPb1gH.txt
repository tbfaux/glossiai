thatgoodglow reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so after I finished filling in my eyebrows I go in with the glossy a boy brow I start by just kind of like going backwards and applying the product my eyebrow hairs and then I will start to curve brush up and blend the product that I used to fill in with this is Prada and I really liked you for that feathered brow look I will say I don't think it has the strongest hold it offers a little bit of pigments and it does really feather out and what happened make your eyebrows look sick but it doesn't make your eyebrow hair stay all day so it kind of depends on what you're looking for but I think I will repurchases Prada I do really like it I don't like the size of the skooly but that's about the only other thing I don't really like about it so
