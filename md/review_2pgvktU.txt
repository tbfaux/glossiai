beautybymonamarie reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: all right so hands down my favorite blush in the winter is still glossier Cloud paint my go to shade is Storm it's like this Violet red Rosy shade and I just love it because it leaves a little bit of a dewy finish so it's not a powder that's like sucking the hydration out of your face it's giving you a little bit of a glow without any Shimmer or glitter so I have some on already I'm just adding a little bit more I put a very tiny amount on the on my fingertips and rub them togetherand I'm just building it up a tiny bit so you could see I love this color because it gives me a natural windburn kind of effects which I really like it feel like it's appropriate for this time of the year I'm very natural easy to blend out built up nicely it's just gorgeous
