ellladaviss reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: this is Agassi boy brow both and shade Brown I just have two of them because I went through one of them I think I went through this one already and this is all I have right now I can't leave the house without less it's literally my favorite thing ever I've been using it for so long I obviously since I have to go to my complaints about it is that the packaging kind of rubs off if you travel with it which sucks but I'm going to open up so I opened up the empty wanted to show you the brush because I really do enjoy it's nice and short like most of the brow gels are I like to like wipe off the excess on bus on to like the rim and then when I'm done I put it back and I like wipe it back off and then put it back in to save more product and I really think this is such an amazing product everyone should have
