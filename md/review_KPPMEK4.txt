zameena reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: my eyebrows are a little unruly lately but this cost a boy brow will help me with that problem what I love about the boy brow is that it holds and it also adds pigment I'm just doing upward motion and then at the end I just do the little shape that I don't need to dip it back in because this picks up a lot of product when you first pull it out I will say this is one of the few brow products that I own and really love I just like helps fills in the gaps that no you might have a hair that got over-plucked or whatever but that's it very cool nice thick brows
