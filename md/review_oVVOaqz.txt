norahwileyy reviews Futuredew by Glossier: hi super great today I will be reviewing the glossy a future do I put on all of my skincare I'm not going to wear makeup today yeah I'll let you know how that goes this is what it looks like on my skin and robbed in you can see where the product is and how luminous it is so I apply the product and I think I look pretty loudly I only apply one pump butit feels very like it is you can tell it's an oil serum hybrid but that doesn't really bother me cuz it doesn't feel like it's crawling in my pores it's very light so I'm going to say that I really recommend this product so you just watching and remember
