oliviahickly reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so I've been meaning to review this for long time for a long time. Billy Joel on the glossier stretch concealer and shade light I brought this back in October and it's really great probably my favorite concealer I have a lot of blemishes so this doesn't cover them that well but it helps cover them and I don't like my skin looking like kickee and perfectly like plastic surgery so I like that this with my skin like be seen and it's just a little goes a long way in order called stretch and it's super moisturizing and gives us like not crusty Dusty she drains wish they had a shade of between this and medium because I think that'd be a better shade for me this is a tad bit to live other than that I love it
