tangomango reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: hey guys I haven't actually been on zapping like a long time I'm trying to get back into it there's just a lot of issues like last time I was on the app and then we got but I'm pretty sure they fix like most of those so hopefully I will be back for it now. Like I kind of just forget about it sometimes so like probably back I don't know but anyways I'm doing a review on this glossier body hero body lotion so I have two times but it smells really good I'll show you all like the actual consistency of itis it out there's a thing my friend Irma heading with that but it's like a pretty sick consistency it smells really good it smells like butt it's like a Saint Rose Type S is very soft and like velvety type feeling pretty moisturizing I also have the body wash to go with that might do a review on that but overall I think it's a pretty good products it's not but it's still pretty good. I like 7 out of 10
