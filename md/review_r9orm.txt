kelseylynne reviews Colorslide by Glossier: I went to the glossy store the other day and I picked up this color slide in the color disaster class and I really like it so far it looks like it's this dark brown color but when you use it it's actually more of a dark Plum maroon shade I've been applying it with light makeup and I am obsessed with the color and Glides on really nice and I think if you have brown eyes it really just like opens up your eyes and brings out the Deep Brown look I was looking for a while for a really creamy easy to apply eyeliner and I think the color slide is a great representation of that so if you're looking for a fun New I look I would definitely recommend grabbing one of these and trying it out
