taylorfoster reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hello beautiful people today I'm going to be testing out the glossier boy brow but here it is I got it in the shade Brown slush run oh probably means the applicator is very small and we're just going to go straight in and apply wow okay so is very hair like Strokes very natural-looking wow wow wow you're going to have to be careful with the applicator and I don't like that I can still kind of see them but I feel like if you're a person who has like thicker eyebrows and just want to take a little bit of a lift I think this would probably work really well for you so yeah I would recommend it
