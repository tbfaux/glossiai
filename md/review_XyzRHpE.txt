lacyp reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: okay so I just got out of the shower and I'm going to put on the glass he a Super bounce it's like to really hydrate your skin you put it on under moisturizer you don't need a whole lot like a lot goes a long way and it just like really helps for when you put the moisturizer on it helps the moisturizer like absorb moisture on your skin and I really noticed a difference cuz I really dry skin so I always put it on at night not usually in the morning but yeah it really absorbs really well and it makes my skin feels super moisturize I also got the half I think this is the one oz to pick sizes like 2 oz is probably enough I recommend this
