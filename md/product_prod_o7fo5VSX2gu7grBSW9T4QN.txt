Skywash by Glossier: What it is: Liquid-to-powder eyeshadow that gives a diffused, soft effect
Why it’s special:
Powder-finish formula (that doesn’t feel powdery) smooths on with a doe foot applicator
Silky, blendable color melts into skin, creating a pretty, diffused effect that lasts
A little bit adds some depth to the eye area; add more for a refined, modern wash of color
Comes in seven shades inspired by dreamy Southwest landscapes
