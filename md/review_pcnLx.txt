samxgreer reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: I've been there for about four months and I really like it because I sense he is great is there a Dewey and there's not a lot of coverage so if you have super dark under eyes I wouldn't highly recommend I haven't shaved light and it is super Dewey the price is great compared to other concealers that is a dupe it's wonderful I don't know what else to say is worth every penny and if you want to check it out make sure you use my 10% off Link in my bio
