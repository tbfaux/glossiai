cgfleming reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to be reviewing the glossy lip gloss in the sheets clear I think this is the best lip gloss that I have tried I don't really wear lip glosses or anything like that I got this for my birthday and I love this so much I think this will cost is literally made me recite the packaging it is long-lasting the applicator is literally amazing I think it's so cool how like it looks like there's not even applicator there or there is but like you can't see the sec I'm going to put it on and show half my lips with and have my lips without because I just want you guys to see the difference from when it's on and when it's not on okay I just asked whether in this is without it and this is what they all the way on I recommend this product so very much and my lip is busted open to that's why it looks very gross but yes.
