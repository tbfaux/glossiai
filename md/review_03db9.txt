danyelmoe reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: the first product ever viewing is the glass case content I have the color light but I know they just expended all of their colors that is so liquidy you definitely have to shake it before you use it as you can see it's quite liquidy in texture and this is the product bonded out as you can see I didn't do a bunch of coverage on but I did make my skin look glowy
