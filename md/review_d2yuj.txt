sarahjgomez reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: hey guys so I mean I already finished cuz I've redone the super you over and over but I use the glitter gel on my eyes services in the shade Phantasm which has I guess you would call it like a note I don't know just like a super reflective opalescent color to the glitter with no color in the actual gel I applied a little bit of nice girl underneath but this is what it looks like just very soft gentle a little bit disco whatever you want to call it under my glasses you can really see it unless I go really close but this is gorgeous everybody needs to try this it is so so fun to use I don't know if I said it before but this is very cold when you first apply it so you have sensitive eyes look out for that
