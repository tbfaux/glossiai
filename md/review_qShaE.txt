hrydri reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: I recently learned that you have to wait until your entire face is dry before you apply sunscreen that the coverage is fall so make sure you do that but I really like this glossier Invisible Shield sunscreen SPF 35 doesn't have a very noticeable smell it doesn't smell like sunscreen it actually felt pretty good. It's very lightweight it has no color in it is very clear and I can apply chili well especially over by moisturizer also something that I recently learned is that you when you apply Vitamin C and sunscreen it actually makes the sunscreen work better so and you should always apply sunscreen if you're using vitamin C and things like that that can attract the sun in damage your skin further so just in tips but I really enjoy this one I'm outside a bunch of other sunscreen even work as well for me so highly recommend
