riyahtaylor reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: what's up guys today we have a special guest my dog Coco and we are doing face mask the face masks that were using as classy as moisturizer Moon mask supposed to be a soothing face treatment you can see what that texture it's nice and Rich but once you applied to the skin it melts this is supposed to help with conditioning oxygenating pissed all over hydration I supposed to pump the skin and always use this after the mega greens Galaxy Pack the yard guys decide to be rude but some of the key ingredients are licorice root lemon extract hyaluronic acid honey and aloe so it's really going to deeply hydrate your skin Coco's over it you get free food ounces for $22 so I think that's a fair price cuz this pot is huge and it's taking me so long to get through it but my skin won't sit
