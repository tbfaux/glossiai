Compliments really well with the body wash and it's just super thick and rich and creamy but it goes on super slick and it feels so good right after you towel dry yourself after you get out of sorry I'm losing my voice but I really love this like I said it's a super light Cent it's not very overwhelming there's the slightest hint of like orange and has to it which I really liked and I think it will be worth it
