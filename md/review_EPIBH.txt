curlyn reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so I have to be glossy a boy brow in the shade black I have mixed feelings about this product because I'm like wearing it on my eyebrows right now but I have like really thick coarse and like at Seneca browse so I kind of find that these don't hold my bra hair is very well but like I have like sparsity kind of on my address so I like it there but as far as like hold especially sounds really thick eyebrows like I do it's not super great I honestly think the Benefit Brow dolls are way better it feels like thicker brows but it's for like color I like this but not necessarily for hold
