emsilly-o reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: everyone back with another review and this one is for glossier priming moisturizer the rich version first of all this packaging is absolutely beautiful it's very durable but also like really travel-friendly this is a brand-new container I just got it in the mail the other day and I will test from this for you so I get about this much and just apply it and the stuff goes on really smooth it looks really really glossy and dewy I mean it is glossy a what to expect but it feels so hydrating without feeling greasy at all my skin just smells and looks amazing and I highly recommend you guys try it it's great for cold weather climates like I'm in dry skin normal skin
