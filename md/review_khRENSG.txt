peachheaven reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: so this actually very popular milky jelly cleanser from call Sierra's you can tell it's conditioning and it's actually really good on your skin you can put on dry skin and cracking down skin I've only tried to calm down skin but as far as I've used it I've only used a couple skorts a few times cuz I'm filing cabinet for holidays but it leaves your skin so soft and smooth gem is Ulta cruelty free which I'm big into and these are the ingredients but I just really recommend I just it is expensive it was the importance or $8 depending where you're from it's just it's really worth it is quite small but you can get a bigger one for 15 Barnes and I don't we just use a facial washes from liking you to Johanna RGB nativia on there just this is the best I can
