sweetlittleindulgences reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so by now I'm sure you've all heard about the mango bomb.com through glass PA it is my absolute favorite flavor out of all of their bombs I do have every single one so I can definitely say for a fact this is my favorite it smells amazing like as soon as I twist off the cap I just it's just so it almost kind of smells like juicy do you know what I mean like you can almost taste it I swear it's so good it's very lightly tinted as you can see I just put a little bit on the back of my hand here and it's kind of like a light Rose shadehere it is Blended out so as you can see there isn't really any like to it which is the only downside but overall I want to buy like 20 more of these
