kaiaiko reviews Skywash by Glossier: hi guys so I have this glassy Sky wash and it's in Valley which is a really peachy like kind of warm color I'm going to go show you how I've applied this onto my lid so that's the Finish luck it's really subtle if you just used one color but of course you can lay on this more colors but I really enjoy about coffee skylodge is that it's not and it doesn't freeze and it really lasts a long time so it's like the same Tower is really just worth that you're 14 around like $40 for one of these but I bought them to to do you said so it's actually a really good value if you're under $30 I think you should get it
