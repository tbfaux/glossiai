teresapecher reviews Skywash by Glossier: hi I so I'm reviewing the glassy Sky wash my have it in the shade pool it's like the soft light baby blue have it on my eyes right now and this is about two coats of it basically you just dab it on with your foot and I use my fingers going to blend it out and then I let it dry for a few seconds and then put another layer on I think formulas pretty nice it feels very soft very mad and it's like like Cloud legs but there's not that much pigment and you really have to like keep wearing it to get to show up and my biggest complaint is just the size of this like it's very little product for I think it's like $18 it's it's not really worth it in my opinion I think it's really pretty but it could be bigger so here's a little Swatch a bit and we just kind of put it on one time and it's just not that much pigment to be honest
