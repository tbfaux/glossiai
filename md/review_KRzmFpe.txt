lattesnskincare reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys today I'm going to be doing a review of the undone lip to cheek palette in the shade Rose would a really cool concept so this one is going to be the most shear and then this is kind of opaque I forgot how it goes but it's just depending on how bright you want the color how you want it to go I don't really like we're blush that often but this really reminds me of reviews that I've seen of cloud paint you as was talking in the background I really like it I have never tried Cloud paint but it's very similar to it so I'm going to blame this in and show you guys look I really really like this and I can't wait to try it out a little bit more and I'll be doing some more reviews later on but this is just my first impressions is very nice
