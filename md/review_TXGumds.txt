kassidynajera reviews Futuredew by Glossier: okay guys I really wanted to give my honest opinion on this I wasn't a fan because when I put it on my face and feels really heavy and I feel really sticky and I don't really like that kind of consistency so I'm just going to do a Swatch test because I do love the glow do we affect it does give you a very Sheen kind of look and it's super super glowy
