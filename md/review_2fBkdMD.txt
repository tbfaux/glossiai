lilyytay reviews Futuredew by Glossier: glossy was launching future do as their next product I was super excited because I love glowy skin and the look of glass skin and I knew I needed to have this so I ordered it on launch day and I've had it for about 2 days now and I'm already obsessed I've been wearing it since this morning and this is what it looks like super glowy I'm obsessed I was a little worried about using an oil serum on my slightly oily skin in the morning time but I find that if I don't use a moisturizer it's enough hydration without being too greasy so I really been liking that and I'm definitely going to keep using this it hasn't broken me out at all which I was also a little worried about so I will keep you updated on that
