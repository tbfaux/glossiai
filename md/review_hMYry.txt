naomiepp reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is the Real Techniques Contour brush do I have so many makeup brushes especially ones for like what Contour concealer foundation and I just don't ever grab any of my expensive ones like her at all this is the one that I use for basically everything like that for foundation if I ever wear Foundation which is really rare and I'll also use it for cloud paint in the shades that if I'm too heavy headed with this I will look like an Oompa Loompa so I use a brush and not my fingers I feel like it goes on a little bit better so I just put on cloud paint and Don cuz of very vibrant orange shade and what I did was I just took the tiniest up likenot even a grain of rice shared between two cheeks worth of it and I just started spinning in a circle and then I blended out the edges and brought it up a little bit concentrating the color right here
