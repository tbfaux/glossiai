lonnekemckinney reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hello today I'm going to be a glossier lip gloss I really like this lip gloss because it looks like I have a lot on when I really don't look sick. But it feels and it feels in the lines of my lips very well it gives them almost like a glass-like. The one thing I was disappointed about though is the the size I thought this would be a lot bigger in person than it looks like it is online but it is a very nice gloss it doesn't have an unpleasant taste or smell and overall it's great but I feel like there are cheaper alternatives that work just as well but that could save you about like $10 but it is nice and I will definitely keep using it so thanks for watching
