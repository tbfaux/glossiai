gracie_mae_1515 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so this is my favorite bomb.com the coconut flavor obviously it is a clear shade but it's smells so good there's it on it's clear as you know bomb.com for a little bit sicker when you apply them so they last a little bit longer they are kind of a lot of money that are $12 but you can get that a pack of 3 for cheap and then save money definitely 10 out of 10 recommend the coconut oil out of all of them
