Kylie reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys so today I will be reviewing glossier's Linn star in the shades van and Herb this is what they look like swatched on my hand 2nd and 4th swatches are rubbed in there all on primer this is what they look like up close of them is two shades kind of remind me of my childhood in like Barbies and stuff they're super sparkly and I like the consistency of it the only issue I have is the applicator it's kind of hard to put on I find myself putting it on my finger and then putting it on rather than just going straight to my lid it's got this kind of applicator I feel like it should be a dropper or something but I do use them very often I'm wearing on my eyes right now
