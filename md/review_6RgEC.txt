weirockz reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hi everyone today reviewing the glossier Lash stick my eyelashes just don't like photograph well videos feel like you can't see but like it looks nice in person I feel like I have to go like links they look and I actually think the price point for this is fair $16 I'm like this is basically an empty not sure if I would repurchase I do like it for travel because it washes off pretty easily it also doesn't do that annoying thing where it falls down and give you like raccoon eyes at the end of the day but this is not my favorite gloss hair product I think they have a lot of better things out there and maybe if they reformulated this I would be more into it
