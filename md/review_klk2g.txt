Gudegude reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: stickers for coffee at milky jelly cleanser in my opinion I don't think it is that good I know it is very popular but I felt like it wasn't doing anything to my face like it did Feel clean it didn't really feel that soft and when I went to my toner afterwards I find out what got a lot more dirt on it than what I've used up her face washes so yeah I do not like this I do like the packaging it's cute but that's really all I can say
