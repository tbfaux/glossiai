amourjnfr reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey over on Saturday I want you to talk about the go see a Milky jelly cleanser I've been using this for quite a few years now and I really enjoyed this I find it's a really simple cleanser it does the job it's not use everyday and I find that it's my most reach full cleanser that I've been using for years maybe because it's as gentle and it just has a job for everything from removing any kind of residue like out there and yeah it's great for my skin especially now that I've been experiencing mild acne and it's not on stripping and I find that it works well with my skincare regime
