lilyytay reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: this is one of glossier's new products from their glossy play line and it's the vanilla clip in the shade Pony I'm wearing it on my lips today and I'm obsessed with the color and the formula it's the perfect everyday wearable nude shade and the formula is sort of like a blotted lip with a glossy finish it comes with a click applicator with a fuzzy top which makes it super easy to apply the product and I would definitely recommend these
