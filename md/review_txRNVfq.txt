christina248 reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: right now I'll be reviewing the classiest red concealer mine is in the shade G10 and I got it from the website for $18 today for packaging super cute simple and a little heavier that's okay when you open it you have to dig it out with your finger and put it wherever you need to seriously before of my eye before the concealer in tears after its kind of on the creamy side ones you can I get it out of the tub thing and it smells super good the reason I said that is because I hate when my product smell bad like it's just a no for me if they smell horrible so over all this is a 9 1/2 out of 10
