TheDanaRipperton reviews Solution by Glossier: alright guys so we are reviewing the glossy a solution exfoliating skin perfector which is another way of saying toner this is 10% AJ BHA PHA salicylic acid treatment let's try it out all you need is this a cotton round and then just press down you do not need a ton on your cutting around and then you're just going to go around I already washed my face and I'm just using it as a toner be careful don't go too close to your eyes that can irritate it but everywhere else is pretty much fair game and you usually find that you get so probably can't see it but you get a lot of dirt off even though you've already washed your face so absolutely love the stuff I have like three bottles so try it out
