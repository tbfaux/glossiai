tangomango reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay continuing on again this is untinted it smells like very simple and fresh definitely like coconuts so if you're looking for like if you don't want to get just the original one this is probably the next best look if you're looking for a super simple one but you don't want to get the unscented untinted one then this one would definitely be another great option so yeah I think if you're looking for a simple but still not like the unscented on tinted one this one would be a great option it does again smell like coconut and it is untinted but yeah it kind of smells like a tiny bit like a soap kind of not really though it's just what I'm looking thing I'm just trying to say it's more like a clean coconut then like a really sweet coconut that makes sense
