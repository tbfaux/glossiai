hannahbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so this is called Chic slime and it's from fresh Beauty which is a brand that I've been really wanting to try so this was really exciting to get as a super great reward and this is essentially just like a gel cream liquid blush I find that it's very comfortable to the glossier cloud paint this one in particular is in the shade field in which is really dark I just watched it on my hand right here and it's like a kind of a deep orange you read so on my skin tone for a blush I don't use this a lot just because I need to be so very careful to use like a tiny amount it is super pigmented but I put a little bit on my lips just to give you an idea it is a really pretty color though and I think that this would look beautiful on people with like deeper skin tone especially because the pigment is so strong I think he's retail for around $18 and I will I guess I wasn't blown away by this but I do think it's a nice products especially if you're interested in a liquid blush
