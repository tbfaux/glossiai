kierstenw reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys today I'm going to be comparing the glossy Cloud paint and the colored Dusk and Merit Beauty's cheek balm in terracotta the Ghazi car paint has amazing pigment you only need a very little bit to get pretty saturated color and with Merit Beauty's cheek balm and terracotta it's very sheer super buildable but it's super Dewey so if you have oily skin that's definitely something to taken into consideration sunbiz cheapest glossy Cloud paint in Dusk and on this one is married Beauty's terracotta cheek balm glossier's is $18 and Merritt Beauties is $28 for their grade it all depends on your preference but I personally prefer the glossy Cloud paint
