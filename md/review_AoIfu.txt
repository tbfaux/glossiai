mollia716 reviews Niteshine by Glossier: I'm highlighter from glossy 8 and the name is called nightshine the shade is pale Pearl so this is what the little applicator brush looks like got a little pointed tip this is how it looks watched on my hand I put a lot on so it's pretty pigmented right here and this is what it looks like so it seems super nice it's really pigmented it dries pretty quickly which is nice but it's still easy to do I think there's a really good amount in here for the price so I think that's a great plan to go check this out
