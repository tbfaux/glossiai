karstynww reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: hi this is my zit stick from glossier to break out a racer I definitely recommend the product it's pretty cheap I'm pretty sure it's $14 maybe 12 I forget it has lasted me for over a year and usually when I applied to my debts I just turn this thing right here about three times and when I press this down usually takes three passes in this it goes away in less than a week who was a very good product man definitely recommend it
