harmonym reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: if you're wondering what just happened in my eyes I've just been a little bit I have a bronze on them to try to even out the mess was happening with the color slide but it's the vine lick vinylic Vine vinyl lick lick and I still okay honestly I've bought this launch like I'm like what was it like 3 months ago maybe 2 months ago and when I'm completely honest by saying that I literally not uses product like at all which is sad because maybe I'm just Eno sleeping on it but also I don't know it doesn't impress me it doesn't do anything special it's not shiny enough it's not glossy enough because a little bit of machine but otherwise what does this do that a regular lipstick doesn't do so I'm kind of on the fence
