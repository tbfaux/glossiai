kaileahf reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: hi guys my name is kailea and welcome to this review so I wish this was a good update but unfortunately it's a bad update if you saw my glass days that stick review you know that I had a really positive thoughts on it but my thoughts have changed on it so I got rid of the glasses that stick a while ago and it was a little after my video blew up I didn't really love only got like six TVs or something but you know what I mean and that was because when I first started using it was doing great you know got rid of my zits 5 sensitive skin so over time it started irritating my skin and I had stopped using it so yeah just beware that if you have sensitive skin maybe don't get that product
