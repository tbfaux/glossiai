abooogie_ reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: so when you talk about the vanilla clip from glassware play I just got in the shade baby which is right red shade is it a couple times already what I love about it is that it isn't drying on the lips it's not what I'm wearing so you will have to reapply but doesn't dry up could pretty much raised and doesn't get in the creases of your lips or anything like that and that the keishin brush is perfect for letting your lips and this nice fluffy brush really keeps the Integrity of the color as you can see just so you can kind of see the shine a little bit it does it is a high shine lip vinyl so the formula super soft it is not sticky at all I love the pigment I think the pigment is amazing I think that brush does a really good job at keeping the Integrity of the pigments and I would definitely definitely got more more colors I've got all these colors
