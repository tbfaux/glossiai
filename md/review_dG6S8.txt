nevibaby reviews Haloscope by Glossier: finally got my hands on a glossier haloscope this is the shade Moonstone so it is like the white you can't even see that because it's binding it is the white one it's not the Pearl one or the gold one anyway it's the highlighter that I'm wearing today and I am in love it comes in a set with the lip gloss and like you can choose whatever shady want definitely recommend I love them both really excited to try this and like put it into my routine probably everyday I'll be honest
