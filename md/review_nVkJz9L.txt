augustmollobeauty reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys I'm doing a review on the glass a birthday balm.com the start off of the packaging I love it it's so cute it's like tell $12 flow overpriced and that's a good amount of product it last 18 months I love it and you slip into your lips were loving layer of nursing moisture so there is a little bit of glitter in it for the cupcakes most so so good so what you do is you take little bit and I don't know if you can see but she looks shiny good are there in like 30 turn out I also have these ones I used before bed which I love her so much driving I kind of figured this was moisturize at detoxifying and like a glowy dewy but I recommend all these and I use them for different things and you should buy them by then if you have enough money so thank you guys
