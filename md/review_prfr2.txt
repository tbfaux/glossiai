bbygurlvane reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: glacis dipstick is a 5% benzoyl peroxide acne treatment gel which is a spot treatment for acne the weight of this dispenses is really nice and has this very hygienic aluminum ball over here you twist the bottom and it dispenses from the top so It Coats your breakouts really easily in the circular shape and it doesn't dry your skin out the skin around it or make your breakouts crusty so they show like more texture and your makeup where is where it's actually really good at just kind of reducing the size without drying out your skin or creating any flakiness at least in my experience
