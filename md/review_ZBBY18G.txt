ellessentially_ reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: ever since I got bangs I have been with my brows because don't even see most of them so brow gel has become kind of my go-to cuz I feel like it does just enough to make the Brows look in tune with the rest of my face if I put makeup on but it doesn't take much time and if it's sloppy then who cares you can't really see I just brush it through and try to shape my brows two almost look like sisters let's be honest they never look even if that's okay and that's about it super easy it just darkens them up with that makes them more of a feature on my face and that way it can even out when I put other things on
