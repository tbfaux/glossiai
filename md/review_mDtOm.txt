jaimiewalsh reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so this is what I've lost a lip gloss and this is one of my all-time favorite lip glosses it's clear doesn't have any color but it like really brings out the color in your lips look like when I'm not wearing I'm wearing right now my lips are a lot like lighter but then this so I can send me color but like I really moisturize your lips also and it has a great shine so make your lips look really like juvenated and like she'll be nice to know last pretty long like I've been wearing this all day and you can still see it so you can see the shine on it and it's really cheap I'm not going to tell you how much this cuz honestly I don't know but classy a it's just like really really good priced and I know tangible that have this lip gloss with my friends have gone through like multiple bottles of it and I just got it but I've been using it pretty much like a lot and I really like it and I think you guys should go to that
