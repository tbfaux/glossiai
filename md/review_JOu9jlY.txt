TessWambui reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: Harry wanted so why do a quick review on the glossy a super brows as you can tell I'm literally out of this act like this is an empty for me because I love this product so so much if you have a dry dehydrated skin and this is the perfect amount of hydration it is hyaluronic acid plus vitamin B5 serum it's like a nice milky consistency you can kind of see a little bit inside but this is the perfect size for Aulani acid it retails for $28 and I would highly highly highly recommend if you're looking for a good head on it that's it
