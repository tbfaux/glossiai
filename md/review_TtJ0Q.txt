mollia716 reviews Generation G by Glossier: reviewing glossier generation G lipstick the shade is Jam which is a deep grape color here's a spot on my hand of what the color looks like this what the color looks like on my lips overall I would give this product four out of five stars I think it can be a little drying sometimes I always make sure to have my lips moisturized before I put it on otherwise it kind of sticks to any parts of my lip that are dry and then the packaging I'm not too crazy about the lid on Minecraft about couple weeks after I bought it I know that they reformulated and I think the new case is a lot better because of metal so I would definitely recommend trying the new ones
