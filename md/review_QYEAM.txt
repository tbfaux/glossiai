Schirb reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: I got the glossy a plastic and to be honest first I wasn't sure how I felt about it if anything I thought it would just be good to have in my makeup stash throw my bag she can working everyday for a touch-up but I've actually grown to really really like it and I definitely can see a big difference in my eyelashes when I don't use it so yeah I think it's I think it's really good it's it's simple it's not too much the stick itself is pretty thin it sounded as fat as other mascara applicators I like
