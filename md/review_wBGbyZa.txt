mollia716 reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: he's a great so this is glossier's invisible shield daily sunscreen has SPF 35 in it it's a really cute little bottle for the price it's kind of pricey it's probably I think 25 to $30 I've had it for about a year-and-a-half so it's lasted a decent amount but I still think like for a sunscreen that you can do using everyday it doesn't last that long packaging is really interesting like I feel like there's more in here but I kept trying to sort it out and it's not coming out so I don't know if packaging I feel like a sort of wasteful but I do really like that it's clear and it doesn't have too strong of a sunscreen smell so that's good overall I think it's a decent sunscreen but I think there's definitely a little bit room for improvement how to put some really cute stuff
