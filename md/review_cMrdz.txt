nevibaby reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so my glassy order came in today just left class y'all I had to know what was up with all the hype I had seen the reviews I had seen people talking about it and I've never even tried their lip gloss anyway and this red just like spoke to me I mean I'm an Aries so I'm kind of drawn to it anyway but it's sent from the goddesses above and I agree but everybody else says about it's amazing and I love it I like that it's not like a super intense but it's just enough didn't like you know it's red and it makes me feel like a boss ass bitch so I'm just going to leave it at that it's worth it trust me
