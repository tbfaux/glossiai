Sillhouette reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: Halo boys did I ever do any glossier's stretch concealer I currently have it on under my eyes and a couple are other areas and I'm really happy with it because it gave me that really natural look I'm looking for for my 70s makeup and hair challenge it went on super easily and it's a really good concealer I was happy with it because I was able to use it without having to put on Foundation first because I was trying to go as like natural looking as possible and I recommend giving it if you're looking for a nice creamy concealer I think the consistency was really good and I like it
