briglows reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey guys it's Brianna today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy stretch concealer cuz everybody is raving about this and it looks so good on everyone else so I thought I would give it a shot this product did not really work for me because I have really bad dark circles and really bad hyperpigmentation I do like the glow this gives me so I like to use it for touch-ups and then I just apply it it doesn't give the fullest coverage but it looks really natural and glowing
