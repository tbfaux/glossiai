sydneydowning reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: okay so I'm going to be doing a review on the glass see a Milky jelly cleanser I'm sorry you can't see it so first off this is the bigger size I was the $18 one you can get the $9 one if you want to so I don't think this is worth $18 I'm going to start this right now maybe the mini one because if your skin is like doing really good I just saying to help at all and it's not going to do anything to it and she's going to like do nothing so yeah it's very gentle cleanser I guess I mean there are better options for cheaper price but if you want this one and you really want something from glass CA that's skincare I think you should get that one or the one that comes first
