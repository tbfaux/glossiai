allison_perez reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so now I'm going to show you how use glasses Cloud paint I love this product ever since it first came out it's amazing it's just the colors are perfect to be honest and I just love it so much though I will just go ahead and continue and show you how I use it I'm using the orange one call Dad on because I kind of orange on my eyelids so this is definitely good for the summer time as you can see a lot of color already Scooby really careful with letting it out and that's basically the Finish to look it just really looks nice natural flush again the colors are really really nice and Vivid and
