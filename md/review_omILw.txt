slblandford reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is the glossier lidstar and I have it in the shade slip which is a really pretty light sparkly pinky color so the applicator is actually just a little like lipstick looking thing and you just wipe it on over your eyes to get all of the product onto your eyes so I just take a little bit on the applicator and rub it all over my eye using the applicator and then I like to just take my finger and like splat it all out rubbing it all over my eyelids so that it's full coverage as you can see it's not very pigmented and I think that's partially the shade that I have because it's such a light pink so it's not very dark per se but I really like it for a no makeup makeup look because it's much more prevalent in person and you can definitely see the sparkles little more so Loki look
