Parris_noextra reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so don't say it is glossy a boy brow is literally the Holy Grail of daytown browse I just want to send just got it today packaging was super cute it's not too dark cuz a lot of Browns are too dark or there to lie there like a brunette versus like a brown or they're just not what I'm looking for it's not a lot of product that comes out when you apply it when you move your eyebrow it doesn't feel tight or anything like that so all-in-all I think it's a win and it only took me about maybe about 20 seconds this is before my other eyebrow so I'll do that I want to show you guys what it looks like okay and here's a finished product I'm going to go in with some of the brown flick in the front just to give it that nice nice hair I don't know what you call it look and maybe darken up the tailoverall I really like the product the only thing I would say is a drawback is just the quantity that comes in at 2 but I have yet to see how long it lasts me so that's up in the air
