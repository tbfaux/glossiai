review reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I have all of the bomb.com except for the cherry and the unscented this coconut one obsessed with it it's not like us sunscreen me like artificial coconuts a kind of I like coffee and I don't like coffee at all but I really like this one first place this one is very close in second I really like to attend because your lips taste like candy smells like candy so good this is a very refreshing the sun is very faint on the roads one so it's third these two types of force just because they both are very very strong you can taste them both this one come as a weird undertone taste to it but it smells so good in this one also smells really good this was last just because there's so many other elements chapstick Alternatives out there
