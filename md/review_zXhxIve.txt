nikkigarcia21 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so I'm going to start with the mint balm.com I love a packaging so cute okay so it comes in a really cute glossier Packaging Che definitely smells minty okay so it it has like a very natural peppermint said if that makes sense like it smells like peppermint tea but like a very nice way also I'm not conjure usually hard to get out of the tube on the first couple times you should be warming up in your hands will be a lot easier I also have the birthday cake 1 and I not supposed to eat it but it's kind of sweet too it's really nice I really like this
