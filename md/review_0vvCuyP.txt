jannakrystal reviews You, Solid Perfume by Glossier: this is the glossier you solid perfume I'm pretty sure they discontinue this perfume but they still have the liquid formula this is what it looks like and I really like it I don't use it that much but when I do I'm always reminded that it smells so good I really recommend it and I really hope they do come back with another one of these in the same fragrance to be honest I really like how compact it is it's really luxurious packaging it's heavy it's metal it brings a little pouch where you can put the perfume so you can take it on the go and it's really convenient for on-the-go so yeah I really recommend this if they do bring it back just
