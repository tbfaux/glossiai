fourteencarrot reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay I finally finished this glassy a mint balm.com I think I could probably squeeze a few more things out of it but I had this forever and that kind of that's maybe my one qualms with this product is I almost wish it was a smaller tube at a lower price because it is hard to get through a lip product this with this Munch within the time it should so this should be says 18 months is the expiration date so that's my only qualm you know what is more hygienic because you squeeze out of a tube you aren't digging your finger into a pot but yeah finally finished I think this is a really kind of refreshing minty flavor and scent so if you like minty stuff and you need a good lip balm I think the bomb.com is a great formula pretty standard moisturizing balm at
