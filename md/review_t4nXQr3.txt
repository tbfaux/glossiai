harmonym reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: this is glossier Super bounce and this is their hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 serum on this is the mini one they used to make them in this size but now they make them in that require larger bottle but I got this from the skincare edit and I would say I'm about halfway done with it and honestly I wish that I didn't enjoy it as much as I do I've tried the ordinary hyaluronic acid serum and it's just too sticky for me it's not lightweight enough it doesn't glide on my skin and although this is expensive for a basic hyaluronic acid serum something about the formula just as such a nice smooth job and Glides effortlessly it feels weightless on the skin and its soaks in just you know instantly it just is a very good hydronic acid serum and if you're willing to splurge the formula is amazing and it delivers great results
