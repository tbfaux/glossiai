Beautykat reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: this is my absolute favorite skin tint I use it everyday it goes on really sure but it gives you the perfect amount of coverage for really natural and dewy look does have a bit of a shine so I like to touch it up with a matte finishing powder underneath but it looks really good I really recommend
