mariskaa reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: everyone so this is the classical. Bomb.com and this is like a universal product of that makes sense like you can use it on your lips or if you have really cracked and dry skin but to be honest this isn't anything to two special is kind of over price for when it is to be honest I think it's pretty much is Vaseline or Aquaphor people agree and disagree with that before like know it's way better or yeah it is like Fastenal core but I don't know I feel like it like what every purchase a coconut one maybe maybe not but I would definitely probably get a different scent this is kind of boring but we packaging is super super cute and yeah it's I don't know if it's worth $12 but it's still good and if you really want to try it out go ahead get it you know but it's not bad
