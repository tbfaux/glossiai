cess reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hi sweetie I'm going to be giving my review on the glossier boy brow and my opinion on the product is that it is great for everyday use is supposed to be for a high school student that is makeup is very minimal and I can grab it in the morning every school day do my eyebrows because I don't really too much and I like the bushy and fluffy effect but I do is I played in short upward strokes and left them out and then come over at the end which is great for the king a little less dead in the morning cuz we are pretty and that is my a review and I suggest it is a 10 out of 10 for me because it is a great easy product that you can use everyday thank you
