fourteencarrot reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: hey guys just reviewing the glossier mega greens Galaxy Pack mask this is one of two masks that glossy a cells and this one is detoxifying mean they also have another one that's more moisturizing I've been having some breakouts around my chin and on my cheeks so I'm messing with this one today I think has a really light texture isn't too heavy like some detoxifying masks are that actually draw the impurities out of your skin while drying it out so I really like this one I have dry skin naturally I don't want something that is going to take all of the mice out of my skinoverall I really like the smash I think it's a pretty good value and love the packaging I have I have nothing bad to say about this I think it's a good introductory detoxifying mask
