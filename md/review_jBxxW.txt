amudaus reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so I know I made a review reviewing all of the glossy balm.com but I just wanted to review all of them individually now so this is the mango bomb., which is my favorite because it smells so so good it smells like a mango Hi-Chew I don't know if you've heard that but it's like Asian candy but it smells just like that service at the bomb.com and has like a coral like small like pink tint and it has like a Vaseline kind of texture it smells so so good at least my lips super moisturized I love this stuff so so much would recommend
