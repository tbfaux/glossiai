dewitpretty reviews Lidstar by Glossier: okay so the stomach is really interesting like it doesn't okay let's do it on the Fly so it's kind of hard to get on and then once you do get it on it's just like a really thin layer of glitter and it honestly doesn't look like anything as you can see like there's a few showers but this isn't really like a good eyeshadow I heard people using it as a primer for eyeshadow so you can try that way but this just gives like no pigment no coverage and it's it's really weird
