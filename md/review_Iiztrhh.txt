springmist reviews Super Glow by Glossier: how everyone's I got these two to pack and I did a review on the Super bounce now I'm doing one on the super glow it is a vitamin C magnesium serum and it honestly smells kind of weird but also kind of good at the same time I would see it smells like almond milk here's what it does to brighten an energized old tarte skin applied Over clean my face and follow with a moisturizer so very similar to the last one also glossy a is cruelty-free so love that
