jettachen reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier birthday balm.com I've had the bomb.com in the birthday flavor for about 2 years now so I actually know a lot about this flavor and I've been using it for quite a bit I've ordered a couple and got him some from the store they actually last a super duper long time I've had this specific one for roughly a year now and it's only like boys like about like this much left and what I really like about this is it's like it's a ChapStick like a lip balm so it's not like as dry as a lipstick would be and I guess a drawback would be the hospital with your fingers but when it comes out there's like sparkles it's really moisturizing and looks super pretty for a nice natural love that still has a little Sparkle would totally recommend
