kayllaalee reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: hey guys so I will be reviewing the glossier boy brow in black today so I can see can't even like see the name anymore because I used the whole thing but it's in the shade black, they come in different shades for like lighter Shades and there's also a clear one and this was my second one and I'm like almost outside try to like not use it as much if I don't need to but it's so nice to like I did I did my browser idea but if you see it really makes it look so full and nice something example if I have this and I want to make it look old was she in like nice and thick and full I justI just do that and it literally makes my brows look so full and nice like I little red one is 10 of the 10 I always make sure my browser done so they don't look like it doesn't look like I don't have brows I really recommend this
