skinrecharged reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to be talking about this glossy play by no lip I think that's how you say it in the shade Pony alright so first off I asked you can tell there's a little bit of packaging normally I mean this would be fine if it was just in this container but because it's a package in a package I found a little intriguing but let's see what the actual product is like alright so here's what it looks like in all its Glory so this is again in the shape Pony so it's it's brown color is who and the packaging looks like this it's a nice wait it's not too heavy but it's also not going to like fly if he barely slick it alright so here's the applicator I almost see if clicked it quite a few times it just take a couple to start off but that's expected and here's the color and then here's a Swatch I want to see really impressed firsthand I love the formula so far and it looks like a really nice color so I'll have to update you
