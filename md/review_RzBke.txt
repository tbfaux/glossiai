butterandbeauty reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: this is Zeke Garcia's round serum from the Super's line on the main ingredients in this are hydronic acid and vitamin B5 but this is basically pretty straightforward how it's going to help to soften and hydrate skin and help your skin retain water moisture better basically not retain water but moisture I like it a lot this is my second bottle of about a third of the way through I might have other serums that have been using lately because he's one of the first ones I got sorry for the honk and yeah I really like it at I've said before it $28 it's a bit pricey for the size but I think it works really well you can feel it pretty quickly upon using it's got a nice thick consistency so you can just kind of press it on and yeah I like it a whole lot less fits pretty and who doesn't like a pretty product
