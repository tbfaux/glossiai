springmist reviews Glossier set Lip Gloss and Lash Slick by Glossier: heavy ones that were going to be reviewing the mascara and lip gloss from glossier I have already reviewed this mascara but I'm going to do it again just in case you haven't seen the video yet so this will scare is $16 and it just makes your eyelashes look really long and it took more of the clumpy like and then I would really recommend this but this kind of gives like a really nice natural look and I really like this mascara and makes my eyelashes like looks really dark and long and I just love it next year of the Celeb gloss and this is $14 I really like this lip gloss it is a really tiny though but it does work really well probably my only complaint is that it's $14 in this is really tiny and it's pretty sticky but it does make my lips look really glossy which is the point of a lip gloss to just to recap I would definitely work on this mascarathis lip gloss I would also recommend it just a little bit on the pricey side and if you're okay with it being sticky then I'll get this
