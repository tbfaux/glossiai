ontheglowNYC reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys so I stopped by and glossy the other day and picked up the coconut balm.com and I just really love going there because I love getting these little bags and really cute stickers I was torn between getting the new mango scent and the coconut one but I just love coconut so much so I had to get it I'm applying like quite a bit of pressure here and it's a little difficult to get product out really easily so I just like to take about this much on clean fingers I need dry spots on my skin so I definitely recommend getting this
