nevibaby reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: okay again like I said my last review of this this is The Classy red lip gloss and this is the colour-pop one that I think is a really good do now in comparison so glossy a is much I guess like tackier I wouldn't say like sticky like it doesn't feel like you know what I'm saying and the color pop is a lot more like I know I don't know it just likes Oaks in it hits different I don't know I love them both but for different reasons so yeah that's just my little comparison of the two y'all can see my other part 1 of this review on my page
