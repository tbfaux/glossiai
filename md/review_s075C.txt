allthedew reviews Niteshine by Glossier: they were going to be talking about one of my favorite liquid highlighters like ever this is from a glossy play I have to shade in pale Pearl and platinum rose I just think I have it right here it's just such a beautiful highlighter it can be built up so you can kind of give it like a little bit more of an everyday look or you can build it up and be like totally blaming everyone you walk by so I think this is beautiful these are the two shades I'll give you better look at these all right so the top one is pale Pro which is my favorite and the bottom one is platinum Rosewood you just a little bit deeper which truly amazing about these is that they do set so once you apply them they won't move they won't budge they stay in place they lay really well on top of makeup and they're just the best
