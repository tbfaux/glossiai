Beautaf reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello so I will review the Amazonian clay 12-hour blush has today I haven't been reaching out for them much lately because I've been using the abh trio glossier Cloud paint and the Too Faced Peach my cheeks blush These are nice they are I feel a bit drier the last Wella last long and the apply really well in blend well so if you are as anxious about getting it I would say definitely get it they are mad and I have them into shadesparty and Harmony I have Harmony on my left and party on my right let me know what you guys think if you like it or not also let me know how you guys like to apply your blushes I tend to use this type of brush a nice fluffy tapered brush and just you don't pass it on the Tetons and it is really smooth
