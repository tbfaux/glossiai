katieee reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys today I'm going to reviewing the glossy a live star and this one is in the shade cub so I got this product from glossier.com for $18 and that might seem a little bit expensive but just brand you know it is on the other side but it's for a beautiful natural finish so I really recommend this among other products from the brand that has a super great color it's supernatural has a scrape applicator as you can see and it is super easy to use so overall I really recommend this if you want a little bit of Shimmer a little pot for the summer again this is the shade Cub it's a nice rose gold and green packaging great product works well last for a long time I recommend it alright this was the review
