sevillathalia reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: this is the glossy lip gloss and the shade red I have been loving this lip gloss it leaves a very nice red shade on the lips very sheer lip gloss is very comfortable and very hydrating and I'm going to show you what it looks like you can see the very sheer red since it looks very glossy and it is but it's not sticky at all and it lasts a really long time which I wasn't expecting and least mine lives pretty hydrate and you know I love it and I think it's perfect for summer
