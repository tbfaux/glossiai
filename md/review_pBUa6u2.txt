ellagills reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi this is the glossier balm.com Trio pack and I got the coconut mango and birthday and these are cases I lost the coconut one but they're really good and you should definitely get them the birthday when the glitter comes off so that's why when I use them a lot so let me show you some swatches this is what they look like not ripped in the one on the right is a cover at the one in the middle is mango and one on the left is birthday cake so this is what they look like robbed and they all looks kind of the same but on the lips looks really good and they really moisturize your lips really well so I think you guys should get some by
