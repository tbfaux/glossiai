kelseysusino reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so here I am with the glossy a cloud paint in the color beam hits you that it's really pretty I also have this in Cloud know and puff it's really it's been painted on this one's really enjoyed. Put some on over puffkins very wearing puff today but I just bought this one today and I feel like this one is really good job of just lifting my cheeks so I really like it and it's super cute and I will watch it so there it is it's a little bit brighter in person but I'm going to rub it in now and rubbed it and you can kind of hell it is like a nice little highlighting blush and I really like it's too cute color and it's raining out.
