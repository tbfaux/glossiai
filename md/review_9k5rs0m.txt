alaiyabijou reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I'm going to be reviewing an all-time favorite of I think it's literally everyone this is the glossier Bob, I have it in three flavors I have the birthday cake let me try this one on the birthday cake smells really really yummy it's clear and it's a little glittery and it's just perfect if you want it to have a little bit more spice instead of a clear lip balm amazing is my all-time favorite is smells like mango hi chews have to light Coral tote practically clear and the newest of all three which I literally just got 2 weeks ago is the fake this one actually smells really yummy it's melted candy and its really rad actually on your lights I think this is perfect if you're just willing to like throw this in your bag and if you want you can just use it as a very Chloe block because he's our skin cells to be can't use
