gabrielarousseau reviews Solution by Glossier: you guys really really wanted to like this I really wanted it to work because I mean it's beautiful but I have been using it and something that hasn't happened in a very long time has happened I am breaking out and that's never any fun and I am pretty sure it's because of this because nothing else has changed this is the new thing I've been trying on my skin and also when I stop using it the breakouts go awayyeah I wasn't using it for acne so maybe that's why it's making me breakout I just wanted to clear my pores and help with my skin texture but I guess maybe that's not what it's for so I rather give it the benefit of the doubt
