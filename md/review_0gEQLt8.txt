makeupmollie_ reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is the other thing I got from last year when I went there it's it was the flagship store was really really nice you have to stand so this is an eyeshadow on my finger really like the Shimmer in it and it is more it looks wet but it's really it's it's not so the only thing happened I tried it when I was there and I started to burn soI would try it again and then I will give you an update if it's maybe it was only the day that I see that it's not working for me I hope not because I really like the color and it's all so you can see it the Shimmer
