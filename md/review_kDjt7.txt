riyahtaylor reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: glossier priming moisturizer rich I know there's probably thousands and thousands of different reviews on this product because it really is a cult favorite but I did need to mention it today because I've been using it as a date cream this product is simply amazing and does exactly what you want it to it's just really sensitive it contains some of my favorite ingredients like red algae and lavender oil and because of the lavender oil has that really nice lavender scent that's really calming and everything about it is so curious look at that nice thick consistency on the packaging is great and being that it's so rich I've been using this as a day cream because during these winter months even though it's warm in Hawaii my skin is still really dry so it does exactly what the priming moisturizer does but with extra hydration
