mariahrnorth reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: I know I'm super late to the game on this end of this is the cheek slime lip and cheek tint it was a reward a long time ago so I'll put a little bit on for you guys as a demobut I feel like it's a little less concentrated than my cloud paint which is why it comes in much a bigger fluid ounce size so it is a little more sheer and liquid Ethan Cloud paint but I'm obsessed with like orange peachy colors all the time
