thatgoodglow reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: so the next thing that I have is the glassy eye and lip Plumping cream so I usually use two dots total and I will put them. Them under my eyes and on my eyelids and then I will just kind of lightly tap it into my eye under eye not into my door don't want to drag because it creates more wrinkles and the eye skin is very sensitive and acceptable the wrinkles and then I will use one more little squirt and kind of go around my mouth on my smile lines and on my lipsfor some extra moisture the ingredients in this our water glycerin and hydro generated I'm not going to try and say that and I found that they are super hydrating
