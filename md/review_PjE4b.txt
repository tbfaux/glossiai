abooogie_ reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: I have been using boy brow for a while now as you can tell packaging is all messed up I'm in the shade black so generally my eyebrows are pretty dark it's just that sometimes the shape gets a little lost so I'm I do use this just to you know get that shape back to let me just show you guys how I use it this also helps in cuz I don't get my eyebrows done and if I have to clean my do it myself so yeah I just brushed back it's a product in there and just like at the top hairs that are finer to see when you compare the two as soon as looks more Fuller and a little bit more defiant I like the brush you look so this works for me but this is boy brow no boy brow
