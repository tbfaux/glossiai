gabrielarousseau reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: so today I am reviewing the Holy Grail of mascara is this mascara and it's my favorite mister I've ever tried and I've tried quite a few and I mean this packaging I can't get any cuter than that so I don't have any mascara on right now and I'm going to put it on now and you'll see the difference and this is how it looks atlantans that curls it gives definition but it doesn't look super clumpy or weird I really like it looks natural and by far the best mascara over the last forever and it comes off super quickly was just like warm water that's it you have to scrub and scrub until your eyes like hurt definitely give it a try if you haven't yet
