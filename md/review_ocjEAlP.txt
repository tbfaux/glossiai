honeydewgloss reviews Haloscope by Glossier: hey so now I'm going to be talking about the glossy how is scope on this is a highlighter stick from last year that I got on during Black Friday it was in one of their sets and I've been trying this for a long time and I finally got it and I'm really happy that I did because I really like it so far so basically as you can see it has like the shade around the outside and then in the middle there's like this bomb and it's supernatural looking so if you don't like that then I wouldn't recommend this here's a Swatch that I did earlier on my hand so this is it not rubbed in and then this is what I found it and I was so as you can see it's like Supernatural and I really like this for a no makeup makeup looks I think it looks really Chloe and just like really pretty so I would recommend it for that
