ontheglowNYC reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: so for my recent or word I got the glossy is it stick it comes in this marker it comes in this marker like packaging that has a rollerball applicator they're going to have to twist it a bunch of times before you actually feel the cooling gel that comes out of it they clean to get rid of problem that exists in 3 hours or less however I don't really have huge acne-prone skin but for the tiny whiteheads that I did have it didn't seem to work on it but I feel like if I had an actual big blemish I do feel that it probably would reduce the size of it so I feel like it's probably something worth trying out I mean this was free for me and I think it's less than 20 bucks on glass ca.com
