harmonym reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: I think I said today and we talked him out of the glossy milky jelly cleanser now this is just a little sample size on that I got in my most recent glossy or when I was ordering the product I'm going to be reviewing in the next video but I just want to give you guys some First Impressions on this so first off this is the first day of how much makeup and got off on my wanted to show you guys to see that it removed most of my mascara but my eyelids and around my eyes are still pretty dark in that mess care about themwhat I loved about this concert I felt like I love to smell which is weird because I'm almost positive it said that's unscented but it kind of got a little bit of like a Rosy kind of smell to it and I love the smell of roses smell really good to me also I liked how ladder. It felt like it was a jelly over my face and not just a basic cleanser and my skin feels really nice and clean so I would definitely purchase
