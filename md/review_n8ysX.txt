bloobart reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: this is honestly up to I guess how what type of washers you like my friend hates this I love it okay starting my house but it's really like jelly jelly cleanser and it doesn't foam at all if you have like a full face of makeup on you use that and like one wash and it's all gone a little emails everything off I love it
