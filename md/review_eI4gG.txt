lexievpappas reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: okay so I wanted to do a little bit of a what's in my makeup bag which I don't actually use makeup bag unless I'm traveling with as of right now I just got home from traveling so plastic I have an obsession with glossy and have like all of their makeup products but this is my favorite mascara just because I'm a very natural makeup kind of person and I've noticed a lot of mascaras pump your lashes together in this does not do that I know it's like hard till I can get it to actually focus and but as you can tell it's like not very it's it's the the stick is different than a normal mascara stick their ego it's got very tiny brushes
