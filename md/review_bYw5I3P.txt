butterandbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay halfway through this is Hayes one of the original four cheese this is described as a deep fuschia I think Barry is more appropriate as you can see we are kind of the very latest I could get it's also my favorite color but so just one I'm not as concerned about doing the cheekbones with I do a little bit more on my apples just becauseit's a little bit more natural so it just doesn't look as intense although on the side of the little bit more flesh but it's really pretty I like I really like at least in the photos how this looks on pretty much everyone there other Shades that I think are better suited to other and I think this one is actually surprisingly very Universal so
