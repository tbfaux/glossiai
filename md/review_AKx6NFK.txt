Sillhouette reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: Halo voice so I really want to review the glossier cloud paint in the color is I currently have it on now and we kind of decided to do a bit more of a notice will look then I generally go for this is my world. They look for the challenge I'm super happy with this act like it did a beautiful job with the color and it Blended pretty easily it did take a bit to get it to get there but I'm really happy with this especially considering my other experiences with glassy a horse like a lot of them are a bit over pigmented which I Learned was a possible thing from them and I feel like a lot of them are better without Foundation but I feel like this one just Blended so well and I feel like this is most certainly a good go to and as you can see we've used a ton of it so I recommend giving it a shot at least
