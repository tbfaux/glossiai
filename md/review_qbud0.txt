vidadeleah reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: so this is bubble wrap from glassy a is served at the eye and lip cream as an eye cream I really do enjoy this product just because it is very hydrated is easy to use and it's light and it does exactly what you expected to do I'm even what bossy a advertise it as bad as a lip cream I'm not too thrilled about it just because it's a bit too light I don't feel like it's a long last Lip Cream it just doesn't give you the long-lasting hydration if you would expect from a lip cream it is something I seen you can use to take prep if maybe if you are to follow up with but otherwise I really do enjoy as an eye cream is very easy to use in a day the only thing is I wouldn't use it at night just because it isn't supposed to do anything else besides keep you hydratedand here's a quick Swatch and literally is almost as so light just like water I love it but eyes in the day
