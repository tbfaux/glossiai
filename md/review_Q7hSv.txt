theemilyireland reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: Hello friends I'm also going to return this glossier's stretch concealer this is Shay GA two things I feel like it didn't really have the concealer coverage that I like really expect from my products and also has a very idyllic King undertone and I am a yellow undertone person I like the way yellow undertones look on me I am I shy more away from kind of red or standard like it just to me it looks almost like white does not blend well in my skin tone or something like I just didn't like it you should I use concealer mostly under my eyes like a few kind of acne spots it didn't really give me what I wanted will be returning this is well I know there's a lot of fans out there just wasn't for your full coverage lady
