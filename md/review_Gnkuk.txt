oliviahickly reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: today I'm going to be reviewing probably the best mascara in the existence of mascara and they going to be in existence I mean entire history of this universe so thanks to gloss the A glossier Lash slick for saving my life because you are the best it's like this silk fiber mascara it just adds like length and darkness to your lashes and it's supernatural which I love love love and hate those chunky spider lashes that all of my classmates do so I love this mascara and how much is it it's like 16 I think it's 16 at 16 so it's $16 so that's pretty fordable forever mascara is amazing it's this so I would definitely recommend
