fourteencarrot reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: I finished another glasses it stick this is one of my Holy Grail products I used it so much so the little ball fell out but my husband and I we both have one we both use it on our breakouts as soon as I start feeling something coming on I get my stick out and I just stop it and if I don't pick at it as it stick really does help shorten the life of that pimple it is maybe a little bit drying doesn't irritate my skin too much because I try to be really precise and just put it on the blemish and avoid the skin around it but yeah I love this product I think at the packaging is great as easy to throw in your bag and go so love it
