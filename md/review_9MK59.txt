lucyhelena reviews Super Pure by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to do a very quick review on the glossier super pure that you can see it now this is nearly empty because I love it so much I'm just going to really quickly show you how I use it not going to talk too much about the ingredients but basically I have oily combo Skin So my T-Zone is oily and my cheeks are normal and I use this is very first step after cleansing very tiny amount and it sucks right in I really really love this serum because it's not oily but you can say that just literallysearch right in and drive straight away so I would highly recommend I feel like it's really helped with my breakouts and I've been using this too much later he is now so absolutely love
