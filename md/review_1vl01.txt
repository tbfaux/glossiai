chai reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: so this is my pre makeup moisturizer I usually use it in the morning and I like it because it's really light and since I apply sunscreen on top I don't have to worry about my face products being too thick I grabbed the smallest product and I just thought it across my face a little goes a long way with this product I just rub it up words I'm ready to put on my phone screen now
