maisyp reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: I'm here with the glossier stretch concealer I have the shade light probably the palest shade and it is my favorite concealer from claw CA or just concealer and general I use it every single day and it lasts a long time and I have nothing on right now and if you just go like this and then you can use your fingers to tap it in and it just creates sort of a little bit of coverage without being cakey or greasy and it's just so nice and I just I love it a lot and it's easy to apply quick and want to talk on its on I just put some on under my eyes my chin and around my nose and it just like a seamless luck and I really really love it
