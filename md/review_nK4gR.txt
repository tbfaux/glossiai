ontheglowNYC reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: So today we're reviewing the glossier stretch concealer in the shade medium and like I said in my previous I'll see videos the brain gives you the cute like little stickers that you get to tone your products and stuff so I've had this since last summer and I kind of use it almost daily and I feel like there's a lot of product let's inside and I think it's a great value for your money so usually just take a bit on my finger like this not wearing any makeup so I'm going to show you it on my under-eye I usually go ahead and also put it on the lid so this is the side of my eye without any concealer and this is with the concealer I definitely recommend this for people who enjoy a natural look as it's not so dramatic
