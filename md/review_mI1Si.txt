katiestark reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: lipstick baby let's talk about it C Twist bottom in the product comes out the little top and then it has a roller ball which I really like I like that it's pretty clear and it's not like tacky or anything when you put on your skin like you know the Mario badescu and stuff but you like how mine's you can see at which is kind of annoying but this is totally clear personally my acne is pretty cystic but this did help flatten them and have enough help with my legs smaller pimples a lot but 24 hours later I had dryness and patchiness and peeling on the service area but I'm still testing it and I think I'm going to stick with it
