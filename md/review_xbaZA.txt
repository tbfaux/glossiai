bellagrace reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hi guys so exam to be reviewing the glossier stretch concealer I have it in the shade G10 unfortunately I will not be testing it today because I bought it at the New York Flagship and then immediately went to beach week afterwards so it's not like that anymore but I will still be with you and yet because it's absolutely fantastic so it comes in a little glass jar like this similar to the Nars pot concealer also similar to other Gaultier products like they're clogged paint a little with a very long way so you can see right here this is extremely Blountville it doesn't crease throughout the day it's super moisturizing but it also doesn't make you look greasy which is really really great for me because I have oily skin so I absolutely recommend this product 5 out of 5 Stars glossy a I didn't think I should buy their stuff because I thought it would be overpriced but it's all worth the money I absolutely promise you
