JayciNicole reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hi guys I have already reviewed those glossy a milky oil waterproof makeup remover but I just wanted to kind of give an update because the first time I tried it I had not ever use micellar water and now that I have I feel like it's almost the same thing so first I just want to show this size comparison so the Garnier micellar water I got for $6 the glossy retails for $12 so obviously there going to be differences in Formula between the two cuz they're not the same thing I don't really know about those but I just wanted to note that glossy does have oil in it has castor oil in it which is supposed to be good for the skin I think I guess and this just has like water and then a bunch of things I can't pronounce so if that makes a difference to you there you gopersonally I prefer the micellar water just cuz it's a lot cheaper but this has been good to me
