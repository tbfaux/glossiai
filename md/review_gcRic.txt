jenpereira reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hairline so I actually just got this from glass here it's the milky oil waterproof makeup remover you're supposed to shake it before using and I swear it's blue makeup remover I've ever used you just put a little bit on a cotton swab and then you just literally wipe your makeup off and literally comes off Justin once way which is like amazing you don't have to be rubbing your eyes or your face so so good
