showyourglow reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: hey everyone I wanted to tell you guys all about the invisible shield by glassy-eyed I was skeptical skeptical about this product because it does have a ton of silicones in it but I tried it on at the store on the back of my hand and it is actually a gel texture so it's not that slick primer like feeling it is a really beautiful product it SPF 30 35 sorry and I have been really loving it I'm wearing it under a full face of makeup today and there is no pilling no greasiness I have not touched up on for about 5 hours so I really really love it
