missylissy reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: hey guys I wanted to come on here to tell you how I feel about the glossy a Ralph lick so when I saw this was coming out I was really interested because I do have pretty sparse eyebrows and I thought this would be the perfect solution to that I pictured being able to fill any little hairs with the marker and it just looking Perfectly Natural however I find that this is harder to use than just a typical pencil or brow powder or what is Anastasia Brow Pomade I just think that it's more effort and more work it's like a marker I felt tip marker where is this brush tip it's a little marker and you just Sue supposed to like Rush these hairs like this but I find that it doesn't even it doesn't come out very easily and it's just a lot of work I feel like this product is not worth the money and I'm not going to get much use out of it
