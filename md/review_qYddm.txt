Smash13 reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: what's up you guys so right now I am reviewing the glossier mega greens Galaxy Pack mask supposed to be at the toxifying face mask I'm just open the just tried it and I actually like it it went on really sick and now it's as drying down is like a nice she need green color I don't know that has like some grits on it so I'm not really sure what that's all about didn't read anything about it but it's not very tightening either which I like I can drink I can eat I can laugh while I watch watch a girl so all I like it so far and I'm about to take it off okay so I just took it off and my skin is actually a lot brighter than what it was of course my kids aren't going to go away immediately but all in all I do like this I love the way my skin feels it didn't dry out my skin
