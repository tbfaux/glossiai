annaD reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay so today I'm going to be reviewing the glassy a cloud paint in the shade so I got this for Christmas. I would show you guys at work at 6 so sick but let's open it up here to this is the more kind of PG tone he looks like this so I'll have it on here so this is what it looks like on obviously would rub it in a little bit more schildpad it and now so this is kind of what it looks like on your skin and a slight Shimmer to it and it looks really nice. Oh yeah I would highly recommend this product for your blush on my way out again.
