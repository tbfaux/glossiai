abaldleo reviews Bubblewrap Eye + Lip Cream by Glossier: hello and thank you for watching so tonight I'm going to go through my p.m. skincare routine so I just washed my face and now I'm about to do the first step which is glossier's eye and lip Plumping cream so I just put a little bit over the tops of my eyelids and underneath but I put just a little bit on my lips one of the reasons I really like this is I like that the packaging isn't plastic it's metal top of this is plastic but most of it is metal one pump goes a really long way you can do both of your eyes and your lips with it it's unscented I really sensitive skin I really appreciate that and it's very soft and very calming I also really bad rosacea and eczema and I noticed that this helps sort of comment down especially in the winter time when skin is more prone to eczema and rosacea it's good price point to I definitely recommend this and it's one of my favorite class E A Products
