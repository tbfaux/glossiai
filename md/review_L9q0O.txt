discobeautie reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: okay so the glossy and green Galaxy mask is a really great mask just for like you know like whenever you have like kind of like you just feel like your skin needs to be refreshed and clean this is great for that cuz it just kind of sucks all the dirt out and you see it's kind of just like a clay like a typical clay mask I think it smells really fresh and when I said I'll just let it sit for maybe 10 20 minutes and it starts to burn that's a need to make sure and take it off cuz that mean they shouldn't be burning I try not to do any more like acids are toners my face when I'm using it just cuz I know it's a little bit harsher but overall I'll use it maybe once a week so I really like it
