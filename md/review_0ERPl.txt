chai reviews Wowder by Glossier: so this is the second powder I use I used to powder brush to apply it all over my face where I didn't apply the milk makeup powder this is the shade light and medium and I really like the powder the only reason I don't use it under my Isis it's because it's a little too dark so if you're fair-skinned like me you would want to play it on the perimeter of your face and kind of Florida Center if you want to Brighton
