__bellabeautyy reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys so I don't explain to you why the glossier jelly milky cleanser is just not it so I own the full size and it is 22 Canadian dollars I'm actually almost out of it I don't know if you can tell but I have I would say definitely less than half last I'm not against its claims I'm really not that's not the reason that I don't like it I hate the smell and I absolutely hate the texture and for those reasons I just feel like it's not a very good cleanser it really is not there's always stuff left over when I have to go in at my toner to so I do not recommend it doesn't even foam up on your face I just hate it I hate it too Stars
