mollia716 reviews Haloscope by Glossier: reviewing Hills go by glossier the packaging on this is really nice as you can see for my hand it's actually pretty in this color is topaz so this highlighter has a center that moisturizes first and then it applies the sparkle around it so it doesn't dry out your skin and it helps keep it nice and moist erised so apply the snow so this color gives me a nice kind of bronze eagle and I would give this product 4 out of 5 stars
