dinamamnev reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys welcome back to my reviews so today I'm reviewing glossier balm.com in the color splash flavor Rose I have it on right now it is coming out of the tube like this she have to put on with your finger and it's a really great thing to use just all over sounds really great makes your lips nice and soft you can use it like on your cuticles you can use it as a highlight someone's like to do that the only thing is you can't really take this out and use it like when your hands are dirty which is kind of gross but overall I think it's a really great product a little bit expensive but I do like it
