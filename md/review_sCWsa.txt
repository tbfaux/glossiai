skinisspooky reviews Haloscope by Glossier: he died so in honor of glassy releasing their new packaging generation G lipstick I thought it would review a glass of your product today so I'm going to be reviewing glossier haloscope so what this is is a cream highlighter and it's in a stick form and I have the shade quartz here so I really helps to give you that glossy when lit from within luck and I have its watched on the back of my hand here so you can see there's not really anything because I'm really more into that Lit from within wet look rather than a metallic look so how do I apply this is a rabbit with my finger like this and I'll top it on the high points in my face rather than taking it like this because I find that it can move your makeup if you're wearing makeup underneath this and I just wish that it wasn't a sticky but that's the only problem I have with it
