bodybeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey body Beauty besties is officially summer and today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy Cloud paint and Hayes so cloudy pee is glossy is take on a liquid blush and the packaging is so flipping adorable it looks like a little paint bottle I have it in the colour Haze which is a really pretty Berry color so I went ahead and applied it to this side of the face and as you can see at that really pretty natural blush look this is what Jesus looks like Swatch and as you can see it's like a really pretty raspberry color so I applied a little Miss side and a little bit really goes a long way when using this product and boom you have that beautiful sunburned look that everyone wants to achieve this summer if you thinking about purchasing anything from glossy I think you should definitely purchase the card page they will last you a long time just because a little bit goes a long way
