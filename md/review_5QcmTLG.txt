macyrcrawford reviews Glossier Stretch Concealer 0.17 oz / 5 ml (Light) by Glossier: hey also I just recreated this look as seen on Olivia Rodrigo for my life thank you everyone who came and chatted with me it was so much fun I wanted to review this glossier's stretch concealer aftershave at G11 it's a little pot concealer so I just use it with my finger tap it on I haven't on under my eyes it does Kris more than other concealers on me but I said it was some loose powder and I feel like it's keeping it at Bay pretty well it's not like going to cover up any blemishes really or pores and just even if your skin tone maintain cover up some discoloration but it's perfect for a very natural makeup look is a slightly greasy texture but it doesn't feel like greasy once you have it apart on your skin and as long as she said it even like just a light pressed powder you should be good to go but yeah that's my thoughts on the bus station
