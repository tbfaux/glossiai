fourteencarrot reviews Colorslide by Glossier: okay so another new shade from glossy 8 color slide is this reddish maroon Shimmer and it's called Saturn return so I wear this Copper Penny everyday similar this is definitely more red so I'm going to try it and see the difference so I'm going to apply to the lower lash line and then on top so this is how I usually apply my copper penny just a really kind of messy Wing so I'm going to apply mascara and see how it looks so overall I think I like the shade it definitely is a darker pigment so it doesn't look as kind of natural and neutral as a copper penny does normally but I think I like it a little bit different but it doesn't clash with my hair so I'm excited for this new shade and to try and integrate it into my daily routine
