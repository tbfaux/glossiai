unicorn520 reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: today I'll be reviewing like Lassie stretch concealer in the shade G11 so I think it's the second lightest she this is G11 Thunder natural lighting I think it kind of has a pink undertone to it so I usually just passed under my eye drug thuy and you can see it definitely widened up the under-eye Circle we can definitely build it up a little bit but not too much it's a really a million formula so this is the before so you can see a dark circle here misses the after
