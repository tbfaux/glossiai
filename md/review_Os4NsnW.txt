victoriaaa- reviews Generation G by Glossier: so this generation G in the color of like some of the generation G when you open it you're going to get this metal casing which is better than the last generation and like it looks like a dark purple color but when you put on your skin it's actually light so when it's on my skin that looks like a light pinkish but kind of gem is color which is a lot lighter than what it looks like and packaging it's a good product but I wouldn't say moisturizing it kind of dry sore lips
