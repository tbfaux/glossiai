mollia716 reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: everyone's a semi-finalist I use the glossier Play Glitter jelly for my part and then for my eyelids super sparkly really high pigmented so if you have any party or you want to get like shine on Zoom this stuff is the stuff you use cuz it's so I catching really pretty and then also comes out really easily so you just get water and it just comes right off which is really nice sparkly earrings got a nice little fun earpiece and I also used a little bit of Vaseline to put on my baby hairs and I also used the captain Blankenship golden waves smells amazing and it's organic and then I also used like a really sparkly lip gloss and yes challenge
