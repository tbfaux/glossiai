Bmak0324 reviews Haloscope by Glossier: now I am viewing glossier's Halo scope in quarts I don't really know how I feel about this yeah and I've had it for a really long time and I honestly don't use it that much the packaging is really cute it has their iconic G symbol here's the bottom of it says quartz here's the inside of it is a two-part formula of the middle is just kind of like a clear almost petroleum jelly Vaseline type thing that helps even make it easier to put under your skin
