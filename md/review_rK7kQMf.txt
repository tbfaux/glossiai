JayciNicole reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hey guys I wanted to review glossier lip gloss today I got this a while ago and I love it I'm not even a glass person but it's my favorite so so you be putting it on and all the usual stuff and it does look a little pink in the two but this is the clear one and I don't know if that's like from getting on my lip liner I can't remember when I got it it looks hot pink I love the dough fat it's like thin kind of I don't know and that's just one coat and it's super glossy obviously so it is a little sticky I don't get really why people say like those of us isn't even sticky flock all the good ones are but anyways doesn't bug me too much cuz that's why were clocks but I just really want this lip gloss I'd recommend trying it out
