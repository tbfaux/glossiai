Beautaf reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: okay so when other thing I got during my trip to La at the glossy store is boy brow so it took me forever to try this because I've been kind of boiled turkey Co or my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel but both of the other ones that I have are clear and this is the first one that I got with a tint in it and this is in brown I really like it it really gives me that fluffy combed full brow that otherwise I would have to use some kind of wax or soapy texture to to create and so this is really nice the only downside and this is like three technical is that I got this two days ago and I don't know if you can see but the name is rubbing off the packaging is pretty so I wanted to last
