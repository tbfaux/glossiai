amberfarmer reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: all right today I'm going to review MD glossier Super bounce this is a really nice it supposed to be ha hyaluronic acid Serum at the very nice however does feel like a gel and I'm almost out with Grace really sad but I would recommend it but it is kind of on the expensive side so if you're looking to get some the luxury I guess it would be for you it. I kind of those run out fast I've had it for like 3 weeks I would say it's not really worth the price but then again it is really nice on your face if it was cheap ride recommended 100%
