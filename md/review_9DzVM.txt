mollia716 reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: I'll be reviewing glossier priming moisturizer hydrating cream so I like to apply the throughout the day so I'll play this after I take a shower and I or before I put on makeup so I would give this moisturizer for and a half out of five stars I really like it how how it's like a sheer kind of build for moisture but I find I do have to apply at a couple times for it to make a difference in my skin
