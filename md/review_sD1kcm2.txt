ReviewsWfran reviews You, Solid Perfume by Glossier: so it could not find this anywhere on super great at all there's not any other fragrances in this like every time I put this in at all like the last or first name doesn't work so this is cold among Amo Ferragamo by Salvatore Ferragamo never heard of it but the bottle looks pretty and this is what the sample looks like it doesn't really say too much or just says an oriental floral so I'm guessing it smells likeI don't know some sort of floral scent from like a different country maybe I'm so much to spray a little bit this on the top of my hand and see what it smells like so this has a very distinct smell I feel like you either love it or hate it smells like orange creamsicle flowers very
