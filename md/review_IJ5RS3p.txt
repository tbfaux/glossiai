miarenee reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: ivylearn today I'm doing a product review on the glossier cloud paint I have two shades with me today which are bean and storm glass he is one of my favorite skincare and makeup brands and I'm so happy they came out with these product is a liquid blush but I also use on my lip sometimes and it's very easy to blend they retail for about $16 each which I don't think it's very bad since it comes a lot of product for example I got this in February and I used it around every day and it's still not even halfway done I also love the packaging for this product it reminds me of a little paint tube then it has the glossy a logo on the back I highly recommend you try at this product and let me know how it works for you thank you so much for watching
