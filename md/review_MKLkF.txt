JayciNicole reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hey guys wanting to review this milky oil makeup remover from LA CA so does come separated but right now it's not so normally they'll be like a white layer in a clear and you shake it up to mix it all together and I obviously have already taking off my makeup for the day I just used a makeup wipe and now I'm in this cotton rounds put it on here wipe it off and show you what comes off with usqueso after already having washed my face with like completely taken off my makeup so I thought this is what came off so here's a normal clean one but things have so much dirt I show my mama every night with Mom this is the extra that's on your fit anyways so I definitely would recommend
