livforbeauty reviews Solution by Glossier: hey guys so I'm doing a review on the glossy a solution which is their exfoliating skin perfector and this is a 10% aha BHA PHA silicic acid acne treatment and I love this I didn't go to work so good I tend to get like blackheads on my nose right here and then a little bit on my chin so it says that you're supposed to use it like 1 Sunday night after cleansing but I don't really use it everyday because I think it's kind of a strong product and I'll usually just put it like on my nose right here and then I might in a little bit but when I put Tan on my face like my Holy Grail product is Isle of paradise and when I do a tan routine or I sautee my body I won't use this because it may like take the tan off a little but it's really good for cleaning your pores out
