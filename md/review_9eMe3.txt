Lai2ly reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: glossier stretch concealer in G11 and it is a bit too late for my liking but it does oxidize I got it on right now and is super sheer this is Avicii concealer without like being touched or no heat it and then the color it gets its melting into skin Em Out instantly is super easy to apply and it's like a lipstick you know like super easy to melt
