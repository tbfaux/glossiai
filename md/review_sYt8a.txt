amberboulder reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: finish up my glasses if he's going to be using Cloud paint in beam skin from the summer to the winter in the color another thing I love about Cloud paint without using the application is so I like to just do it. Don't use cheek and then lend it out by tapping it once I'm done blending I just took whatever is left and apply above and below my bro because Sherry said to do that and I trust her I really love Cloud paint because it's super pigmented a little bit doesn't really long way and it's also really thoughtful if you want more defined plus I mean like this because it feels like it's on December 1st to polish my face makes me feel more alive and how did I feel in the winter
