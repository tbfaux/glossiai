dryskinreviews reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: to this is glossier cloud paint and puff I think it's a really pretty buildable color is pretty subtle I'll show you what it looks like I'll give you a Swatch and all she how I fight my skin okay so here's it's washed on the inside of my arm it's pretty pink but as you can see it's pretty sure you're okay so just have a little bit right now but to build up the coverage I think a little bit of my finger is smile to put on the apple of my cheek and then I actuallybring it across my nose to make it look like a kind of been in the sun cuz it's kind of like the color of my sunburned skin and is that Alex it's pretty subtle but I think it makes you look nice and flushed and healthy so.
