marcelaillustrates reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi Francie I'm going to be reviewing glassy eyes birthday balm.com I am lip balm upset and this is by far one of the best friends that I've ever tried what I like to do with this is a play at the glare at night to create sort of like a lip mask and leave it all night so when you wake up it's really all nourished old soft like a baby lips but this is definitely a little chunkier than mango bomb.com so if you don't mind that it's really not a problem but if you do like like really smooth lip balms that's an issue with this but aside from that it's perfect I love definitely a staple of my skincare routine at night
