sonyakornitsky reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey super get so I have another review and it's on all of my glossier balm.com I have almost every single flavor the only ones I don't have as a coconut in the original one I don't plan on getting the original one but I am going to get the coconut one the texture of these bonds are kallik Vaseline in my opinion they're pretty thick and long my friend said that they're not but in my opinion they are some habitats ends like these three the wild fig the berry and Cherry have a strong 10th and then the rest are either like non-tinted or like these to the Rosen the mango have a tiny dent like they're like very sheer like they're not really tempted but look it kind of shows a little bit my favorites probably have to beZ's 3 at the moment the wild fig Berry and Rose the Roses
