sarahisenberg reviews Lidstar by Glossier: just want to do a quick review of the glossy lid star bring it today in the color slip as you can see it's really subtle I like that gives a lot of Sparkle to be really beautiful pink I don't wear eyeshadow that much but this is the one that I do wear the most I would say so yeah I would really recommend this
