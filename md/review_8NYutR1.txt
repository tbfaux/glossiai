ava_1818 reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: trisodium give me reviewing the glossy holographic lip gloss looks like this little man that has a little bit of some packing is but I don't really mind it so that's fine and has a nice shine but it does not smell like anything so ready for a few more won't mess up with that it's really good gloss I recommend
