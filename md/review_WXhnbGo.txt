priscilla reviews Wowder by Glossier: so this is glossier wowder and as you can probably tell I have like nothing left I'm basically done with this even to get it I have like really hard to get out I'll be just a literally nothing left but I really really enjoyed this product I actually this is the older one this is like two mediums before they kind of discontinue the 3 and then made it like G like when they made him I think they made a wider range when they did that but anyways this would be I guess equivalents like G7 because that's what color I wear in my stretch concealer and I really like this it's like a lighter formula I feel like if you're somebody who likes a more you know like a more music more coverage this is probably not for you but for somebody who just likes to like one two three you're out the door kind of every day for me personally I love this
