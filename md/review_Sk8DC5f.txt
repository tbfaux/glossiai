priscilla reviews Generation G by Glossier: okay so the last thing I have to share tonight is what I have on my list and I have on glossier's generation G and I have on the shade fresh not sure if I can see. But it is Crush I love this product I love all of the shades of generations either I'll just work really well for me but I don't love is that the lipstick always calls out no matter what shade you have that's how he's going to happen and so it's really disappointing even with a reformulation that happens also another thing that if you're thinking about buying is the cap does not stay on when you push it down it literally just like pops back up and so yeah those are two negatives but the color is really cute I love it it's a very drying formula so just keep that in mind but I have no I don't mind at all because they don't like for any lipstick and this is what it looks like on my skin complexion so
