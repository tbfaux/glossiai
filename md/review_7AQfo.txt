lexievpappas reviews Solution by Glossier: the review that I'm going to do now is for the glossy a solution exfoliating skin perfector I absolutely love it. Everything in it that I would need and it doesn't like have anything abrasive in it so that it like tears the skin cells so it's more of an acid exfoliator so first you just a little pads I want to see a pad and then I like to do it right after I'm done showering so I feel like my skin is really clean little bear from not to just get everything how do I get my nose you can't really see cuz it's like probably not close enough but it really makes my pores look a lot smaller after I use it like I said I really like to get in there only knows cuz I feel like a problem spot on report tonight Enrique
