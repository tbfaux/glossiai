beautedefile reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: for another product I received in the super great giveaway is the body hero shower oil and I actually this product has gotten a lot of hate for the send but I actually love this scent it's really really musky it's smells straight up like orange blossom which can be a little bit musky for some people but I absolutely love it I love that it is long-lasting and I enjoy using this to shave actually so it's really really hydrating and it leaves the skin super smooth
