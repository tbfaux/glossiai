kathryng reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: he's super great today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier universal skin Salve balm.com I have two flavors that I'm going to be reviewing today the birthday cake one which is really old and very beat up and then the men go on when I start with the mango on this one smells so good and it has a slight tint but the smell it just smells like so good and then I only like that much I don't need this one on my list and then the other one on are this one of my cuticles and the other one of my lips but it's really moisturizing and all you do is I just for my cuticles when I put on my cuticles just take a little bit and drop it into my cuticles and it leaves my cuticles feeling really moisturized didn't have my lips on my just put it on my lips and my lips are so much trust you can find these on glossy and they're amazing I would definitely recommend buying
