zenyoubih reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys so I'm going to be doing a review on the glossy milky jelly cleanser I don't use this cleanser very often just because I have other cleansers that I use simply my glycolic cleanser but this is a really good to use like if you've been wearing makeup all day and then like you get home are just like us like I need to make sure that like my skin is deeply Cleanse This will literally get the job done so well so you can either use this dry like with the dry face or a wet face I like to do it with a wet face in the mornings if I don't have my makeup I just wear it in about like three or four pumps and then I just wrote and goes on basically clear like you can't even see it but you could feel it and honestly it feels amazing like it's super gentle on the skin it really doesn't have much of a scentI just really really like it has like a morning kind of cleanser every now and then if you like gentle cleanser is definitely check this out
