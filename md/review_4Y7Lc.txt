butterandbeauty reviews Solution by Glossier: this is the famous or inFAMOUS glossy solution depends on how you feel about it I have gone through most of the bottle I ultimately didn't think this was that amazing but then again I don't suffer from a lot of acne so a lot of people who have ended up loving this may be needed a bit more with a 10% active ingredients it's pretty strong and it always with my skin feeling kind of tacky afterwards and made it hard for other steps like serums and moisturizers to absorb so I've been using this more as a spot treatment which is the only effective when I have you know likes breakups coming out but I don't think I'll be able to purchase and just because it didn't do that much to me I think there are better exfoliant out there chemical exfoliants and ultimately it's not a product I really need even though it's cute so that's just my take
