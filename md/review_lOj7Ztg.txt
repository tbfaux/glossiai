showyourglow reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys this is the milk makeup lip and cheek in the shade perk I wanted to talk about a cream blush that is not glossy Cloud paint however I do love that one this is a great alternative I want to say except it isn't a stick form so that is a big difference clearly but the blend ability isn't there it is beautiful and it lasts I have it on today I just do a couple of dots on my nose too and Blended in with my fingers and I have topped it with powder and it's still shines through typically I will add a little bit of powder blush on top to set it and add that longwear look so that the end of the day I still have blush on but this is a great product for a fresh spring you look to make your skin look naturally glowing from within so I definitely recommend it is gorgeous
