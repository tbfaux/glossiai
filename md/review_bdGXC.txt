ontheglowNYC reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is the glossier cloud paint in the shade puff it's basically a blush but in liquid form I've had this for about a year now and I use it almost daily and there's still a lot left Play I Like to Pilot is to put just a little bit on the back of my hand and then you want to go and get out a little too warm it up so it's a little bit of that product on my ring finger I like to just blend it out onto my cheek area we can also use a beauty blender to this and I'm not wearing other face makeup so I might look a little harsh this product is under $20 and a little goes a long way
