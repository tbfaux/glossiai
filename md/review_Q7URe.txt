sarahjgomez reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: hey guys so right here sure you heard it about a thousand times but I have the glossy lash slick and I just had to tell you it's one of my favorite everyday mascaras it's really early in the morning so just do brows gloss lashes cuz I don't care not sickening it's not anything special like that but it is lengthening really does separate the lashes nicely I've never used this and had clumpy mascara this is supposed to give the illusion of falsies although I've never had fall asleep the longest my lashes have ever loved and you should get it it's amazing
