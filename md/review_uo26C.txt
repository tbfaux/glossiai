clairewalter reviews Generation G by Glossier: so I've been using the new formula of Gingy for a few weeks now this is the shade Leo which is has been one of my favorites for a long time I love the look of the new Genji it's much more Luxe and mature looking when you take off the top that being said I'm not the biggest fan of the new formula the old formula went on much smoother on my lips and I like to the coverage better I'm having a little bit of a hard time with the new formula right now I have lip balm on to help the lipstick Glide but I think you'll still be able to tell what I'm talking about is he I'm pressing harder than you should have to press to get the color to transfer and the coverage is so light so this is after three applications now I still love the color but not the biggest fan of the new formula
