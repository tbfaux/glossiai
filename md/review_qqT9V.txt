isabellamjohn reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: this is Benghazi a boy brow and I am obsessed I know this product probably has so many reviews and all of them are probably super positive cuz it's literally like the best brow gel that I have found it doesn't cake at all like it doesn't feel like crusty after you put it on which is something that I've noticed a lot of other brow gels do and I think that it gives a supernatural look plus you can build it up for more of a like finished Broward I just kind of swipe it through my eyebrows few times and as you can tell like so much product comes off that's what I'm going through it once a month before and after I already have pretty dark eyebrows so it's hard to tell them mediate difference but it definitely does a lotoverall I just really really recommend this product I feel like it's great for anyone that is looking for like a natural brow look and then you can also pair with other products to get like a full Glam brow
