thechicmachine reviews Solution by Glossier: so I just finished my first bottle of glossier solution and I have been using it for a little under a year so I've been able to see some long-term benefits the main thing being I have far less texture in my T-Zone then when I start it it's mostly here now where is before it was all over my forehead another unexpected benefit that I have gotten from using it is my Eczema I have a lot of dead skin on my neck and I kind of use it to as a chemical exfoliant to get the dead skin off which is really awesome and not something that I think a lot of people think about when they think about those exfoliant but it's a really good use for it and the only thing about it I didn't like was the pump the pump did work I'm just not a fan of using pumps for my skin care products I prefer to be able to pour it out onto a cotton round other than that I think you'll like it a lot it looks really good on a shelf e and I think you guys should try it out
