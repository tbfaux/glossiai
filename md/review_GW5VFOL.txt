yasminealexandra reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: glossier stretch concealer a shade G11 it's the second lightest shade and it is a very very creamy consistency and almost kind of reminiscent to like a bomb sort of thing you can see it just melts into the skin but I really love to do and Lauren Mae Beauty on YouTube showed me this in her video and I love to put the beauty blender inside this and use this to kind of touch up my makeup when it's starting to look a little dehydrated I really dry skin and being able to touch up throughout the day with a really crummy product like this is actually so convenient for me this product does not give you a ton of coverage so if you're really looking to cover things like blemishes and this on this concealer is not really for that it's kind of for that more natural look overall I love the concealer being able to find your shade is really easy because it's years out so a bunch of different skin tones can get away with the same shade
