kaiviolet reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: since my last one it's the birthday cake and we're going to try it out it's hard to get open for hair real I love the packaging it's so clean and I love like the words are different colors and sparkly I love it sorry I look like this I literally just woke up and I had to throw my hair up and my shirts for like you know its troops okay so we have it on my finger it smells pretty good it's hard to tell, but this one gives more of a sign then the coconut I'd love love the smell it smells just like a cake like you know for the cake it is very much stress of obviously a 9.5 out of 10 thanks so much for watching by
