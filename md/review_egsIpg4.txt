susanna_1917 reviews Futuredew by Glossier: hey guys so this is the glossy future do so when I first got this I was actually really surprised by the packaging cuz it's actually really pretty and it's made of glass which is kind of different so this is a oil serum which is really good for like dry skin and hydration, cuz you like this really Natural Glow so you don't even need like highlight or anything so I usually just use like one or two pumps for my entire face actually out on my finger it melted in my hand and you just put all of your face or like on your chin bonds or anywhere you want like a little extra slow and it's really hard rating and price is really nice like ginger smell to it which is really cool
