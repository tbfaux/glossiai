andymae reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is the glossier lidstar in Lily it is meant to be an eyeshadow a liquid eyeshadow but for me it is a little too sheer and honestly not worth the price can't really see it and it's and if it doesn't dry fully it just looks really splotchy don't waste your money
