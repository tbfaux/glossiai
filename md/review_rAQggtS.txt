amberfarmer reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: all right this is D glossy a rich priming moisturizer this was really nice it is sort of thing but I also have dry skin dry to combination skin in this works really well I've had it for a couple weeks now and it is about for the way through so I have about three quarters left which is really nice I only need a couple go back to my face and then I rub it in its really nice however it is kind of expensive clothes here is an Electra brand that I do recommend this for dry combination for the sticker
