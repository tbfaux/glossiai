kennedysmakeup reviews Solution by Glossier: hey guys today I will be reviewing the glossy a solution it's $24 on the gloss a website and it's basically an exfoliating toner there's been a lot of hype about this product and it's even when compared to the BIOS EP 50 so I've been using the glossy a solution for a couple of months and honestly I'm kind of disappointed the solution claims to reduce acne scarring and pigmentation and just a couple of weeks but I didn't really see any results it has made my skin a little bit softer but that's not enough reason for me to continue using this product I think most people just buy this product because of the packaging but if it really works for you continue using it so that's the end of my review and I hope you guys liked it follow me to stay up-to-date on upcoming reviews by Guy
