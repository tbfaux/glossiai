earthismyheaven reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so my next step is Browns and I use glossy boy brow this is the one that has my products and this one I cleaned out with alcohol and it's just a clean spoolie so this is the cleaned one and I will take this one first and just brush my brows out so they're up and just come through let's just helps give it a nice place in my opinion so then I'll take the one with the product and I like to wipe some of the product off the edge so it's not too much and then just go in on either side then again I'll go in with us and just brush through the product one more time just to make sure there are no clumps or any excess product that I don't want
