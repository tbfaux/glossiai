nattastical reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hi guys so I have the trio here and let me just say I love this lip balm I know that I've heard that they're overrated but they're amazing I love the formula it's petroleum-based it's very soft it last through the day and has multi uses I have some of my lips right now and on this eyebrow and whenever you put them on your eyebrows if you don't want to give you about it last through the day like you're not going to get this crazy little stray brow pieces at the very front like go this way and I just I love is very hydrating it smells and tastes great there's really not much to complain about this product I will say that the birthday cake does not the glitter does not spread but it doesn't last all day but overall I'd give them a 9 out of 10 like close to 10 out of 10
