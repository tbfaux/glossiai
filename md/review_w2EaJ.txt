_emilymarie reviews Wowder by Glossier: hi so I'm going to show you guys how I use Wilder from glossy a this is the only product that I use in my whole makeup routine or requires a brush and I just use this like $3 one so really thriving here but I love that it is it has this like trampoline thinks everything kind of stays really nice and clean was awesome. It is it set your makeup and takes away like the really like really oily parts of your face but it leaves behind like your natural do and your Natural Glow to your skin so you feel you don't feel oily but your skin is still glowing from underneath the powder which I love cuz it doesn't like soak up all of your oils where skin just feel so tight it it's like smart and it knows it knows what but no it's my favorite go get it
