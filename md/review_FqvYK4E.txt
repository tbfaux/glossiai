JayciNicole reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hey guys I wanted to really quickly review this glossy lip gloss I got this in today I had the clear one before so I already knew I loved it but this is the holographic shade until it's so pretty I'm wearing it right now just so you guys how sticky it is you see that so you don't like sticky lip gloss why are you annoying lipgloss but cuz I'm just getting on board with it glasses but I love this one it feels super like Smooth like when you go like that it doesn't stick to itself I know it's kind of weird but somewhat classes do I just feel really good on your lips it'll last long time and the holographic one I definitely would recommend I thought it might be too like sparkly to pinky on my lips but it just looks extra glossy in my opinion so try it out
