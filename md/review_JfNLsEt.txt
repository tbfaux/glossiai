zameena reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: everybody's so I could not find the product listing for the priming moisturizer rich or glossy a stagnant here this is a full-size product and it is essentially just a thicker version of the the product that actually tagged is just the regular moisturizer and here's what it looks like it's hardly gives me like Clinique Vibes like my mom's favorite moisturizer from like Macy's I really like this it has like a a light powdery scent to it so it's a little Grandma but I really like it in a little really goes a long way so the spot has lasted us already a couple of months if they ask my boyfriend also is that so I really like this stuff it's a little bit pricey but given how much it last and how good it is I think it's worth it
