thekristynedit reviews Generation G by Glossier: if you guys are looking for the perfect everyday red then look no further than glossier's it ever owned it is so pretty and it's what I'm wearing right now I do find this bread to be a very poppy red so it has a lot of orange in it so it's like a red orange it's not one of those sheets that are going to make your your teeth look really white but it's just such a beautiful beautiful red and the the formula of the Genji lipsticks are so pretty oh my God like it's just so comfortable and what I like about zip is that it leaves kind of a stain behind so even if this does fade off your head like a really beautiful like a red stain to your lips so I love zip from glassy I think that this one is actually worth the price just because of how beautiful it is and how long lasting and likes
