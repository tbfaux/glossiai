helenemmert reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: this is a classy Rose balm.com and this is basically the best lip balm I've ever gotten it's really good and moisturizing especially for dry lips and the formal is a little bit hard you can see but it's actually really good to use its I love this and the packaging is actually so cute I even kept the box and this retails for $15 Canadian but it's really good and it's definitely worth the price
