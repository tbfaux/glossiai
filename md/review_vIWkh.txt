butterandbeauty reviews Glossier Soothing Face Mist by Glossier: this is the law CA soothing face mist rose water spray this is the new version on they just released it in a couple of months ago I want to see the package has new the Spritz is much finer which is really good it's been used to be way too much but at the end of the day it's fifteen bucks for a rose water spray and ultimately that's kind of pricey I mean you're really just paying for the brand on the packaging here and it is lovely I just think that's kind of ridiculous because you can get the Mario badescu 147 bucks for a larger size or at least the equal size so yeah I like it if you're just like really into law CA then go for it but if you'd rather save your money I'd say go for the Mario badescu on
