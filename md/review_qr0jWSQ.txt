KateP111 reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: High B12 jamian be reviewing the glossier cloud paint in the storm or finish a storm sorry I haven't done this week so do I and it's one little goes a long way so I just do three little dots and I just Blended out just a thought it looks like well at first but you just Blended in and if you need a little bit more helpful and mean to blend it with a beauty blender so when so blind and I do have a little bit too much on my face but it's okay the good thing about it is that it's very blendable which I love there's multiple shade and it last for a very long time because you only need a little bit for your whole cheek area I probably about my nose as well but anyways I give us a 10 out of 10 I really love this if I would buy one thing from coffee it would totally be another clock paint
