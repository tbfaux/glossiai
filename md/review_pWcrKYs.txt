FootprintsbyDianna reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: this is the classiest bro bro I've purchased this twice already in the past two years since it first came out and this is a staple product of every day's look it has a waxy consistency heavily pigmented so you can come through to create depth additional hair streaks but most importantly it settles each hair nicely I just love this product and I'm going to continue buying it and buying it time and time again
