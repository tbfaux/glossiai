Bmak0324 reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: I am doing a review of glasses that stick I actually did not get this through super great I bought this the day that it came out on glossy I was really excited about it never really works for me in the past they just really dry out my skin in ears he is and I was hoping this one would be different but sadly it's not like I said I bought this when it originally launched so I was just kind of waiting to testing it out to do a review on it I mean the packaging is so cute and I wanted to love this so freaking bad it just it really irritated my skin at me red and it did not make any of my zits Fade Away in fact I feel like I made them last longer which is really sad I know other people love this product and just as not for me but what's great about glossy a is if you just like any other products all they will reimburse you I'm being reimbursed for this and they just have the most amazing customer service so
