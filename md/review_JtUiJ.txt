skincare_obsessed_ reviews Lidstar by Glossier: no I don't feel like I talk about makeup and off on here so I want to talk about and eyeshadow product that I think it's really interesting and it's the classy a little star is this a tot of times and this is an interesting product I like it but I don't love it and what holds me back from loving this is I think it where is really terribly when you don't lay on top of the Shadow so when I use this alone with nothing underneath of it it's pretty much gone off of my eyelids like 2 hours which is really annoying because I really would love the way this looks and wish it stayed on a little bit longer by itself but I absolutely love the way that this layers over any eyeshadow so for that I would say it's pretty good but if you're looking for something to wear on its own I would not get this but it is beautiful over shot
