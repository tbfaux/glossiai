nevibaby reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: so my glass a order finally arrived today and I got the glossier skin tint in the shade G10 I also got these really adorable glass eclipse pink and I love it anyway I went ahead and already put it on absolutely love it it's not full coverage like it says it's really not it's really just feel like perfect a skin tone just so you're not like red here you know purple hair or whatever your ish is I am a little rat on my cheeks always I know that I love blush but it's like I don't want to be like that like super skin red you know I'm saying so I definitely recommend this I love it a lot I wish that I had just gotten the skin 10 + concealer all at once cuz it would have been cheaper would have said like $12 but I was drinking the dumb bitch juice apparently anyway never approved
