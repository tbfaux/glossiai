thekristynedit reviews Generation G by Glossier: hi guys so I wanted to quickly jump on here while I'm sitting at a red light that I've been at for like 5 minutes and review glossier's Genji in the shade sip this is a new formula of the product it comes in the Night 2 and the product is nice and thick and kind of smells like roses I like this but it's super crying a little bit crusty previous step dad I feel like this was a lot more like kind of on me and not so much like I don't know pretty red but she I prefer the old formula when it comes to Leo is well I don't know I don't love the shade on me and it's drying and it looks kind of nasty so this is a path for me
