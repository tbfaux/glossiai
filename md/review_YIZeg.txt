asenciosol reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: guys so today I'm going to be doing like a really quick tutorial kind of thing of what I've been using other my skin has an acting really weird so we're lighting so I'll get better but right now I'm going to start off with the glossier SPF Invisible Shield I really love this product it's absolutely amazing whenever I use it I feel obviously protected it pretty low and SPF but it's actually really awesome still just the fact that visibleis great it's a little pricey but I think that if you want to splurge it's an awesome item to use
