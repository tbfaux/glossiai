umbrellma reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is the glossier lidstar in Cub this is a liquid eyeshadow which is so gorgeous it's a very subtle kind of bronze a color which is very user-friendly very easy to use it is not pigmented however when you put it on it scatters quite a bit and you do have to layer it a lot more if you want this type of color on your eyelid but if you're going for something everyday it's really really really pretty just putting it on your on your eyelids just for a simple and quick Glam so I would totally recommend
