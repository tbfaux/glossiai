gretchenstevens reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: I also wanted to talk about glossier stretch concealer I love my can go da I refinance it concealer it's just a little expensive I mean the little teeny tiny to do with like $60 or something crazy so I've been on the search for a more reasonable concealer and that last a little bit longer and I love glossy eye concealer is great it's really reasonably priced and it honestly Blends so well with my skin and it doesn't feel heavy or clogged my pores I have it on right nowyou may schedule a ride but I really do love it I love it you can't tell where your skin and the color of the concealer start it's so important to me that it's seamless and I really feel like it is me and sometimes it doesn't cover up the intense super red but then I don't know how to do color correcting so that's on me but I really do love this stuff and I use shade medium and I think it looks great
