crybabyspice reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey y'all I'm going to be reviewing glossier milky jelly cleanser a conditioning face wash today I'm going to do a demo first and then let you know about my opinions about this wash so I just thought I wash my face and I applied it with wax and we can also do dry skin and I really like it cuz it's conditioning you know it's moisturizing it feels like Vaseline so if you want to text her that smartphone is my not be for you that being said I think that there's a cheaper alternative out there right for Robbie I really like to use this in the morning as well and I feel like it's cheaper it's just as good maybe even better
