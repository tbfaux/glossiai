alisa reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm going to be talking about to be Cloud paintings by Cartier love and there is so nice if you want to really nice flash of color very light 1 please give you just that you can layer them or you can go for a really minimal look they really can do so much and I wouldn't be that expensive there Bisquick the same as any other blushes so I see they're pretty good there are really nice gel formula and that makes blending them so easy these make me look like I actually tried to remake my makeup when you can just use your fingers they're really cute and they're really aesthetic like the bottles of them so I would actually really recommend these in though I didn't think I'd like them that much since I'm not really that into makeupbut if you're just starting out with makeup I want like something light this is definitely something that you guys shouldn't get an especially if you like it cute to make up this is definitely very cute
