jaimiewalsh reviews Lidstar by Glossier: these are the Los Angeles Stars I have moved three colors this one a slip this one is van and this one is cub and I really love these I just got them and like I reuse them pretty freaking frequently like sounds on eyeshadow it comes out in like pina colada Claus will stick thing and then has to go glitter on it and if you can fit so visits but you just apply it to your lid and these are my three favorite colors this one is kind of like a looks pretty brown on here but like econoco purplish sparkly Brown and its really shimmery and I think it's very pretty and I sit next to Cub Cub is like more rose gold and it's also very pretty and I'm sleeping like a baby pink and if you blow them out if I'm so psyched
