zameena reviews Mega Greens Galaxy Pack by Glossier: that Sunday and I want to share a bit about this glossier Mega greens Galaxy Pack detoxifying face mask and you leave it on for 20 minutes here's a texture it's got little bits that I honestly don't know what they are but they're supposed to be for exfoliating and cuz it does kind of set I will make sure that I mix it up a bit before I put it on my face so don't do anything fancy I just kind of like put my fingers in it and start typing on my face and I put a real a relatively thin layer on so I look a little silly but I love putting this on cuz it makes my face tingle a little bit in the bag or burning it feels like it's really clarify my skin once it's done I just wash it off with some warm water and my face always feels super refreshed and detox so
