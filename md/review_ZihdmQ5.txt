harmonym reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: all right so next removing to the gloss a perfecting Skin So now this is something I still kind of mixed opinions on something that I have a love-hate relationship with and also something that it's like when this Runs Out am I going to buy another one I want to but at the same time I don't feel like the prices Justified if you know anything about this product you know that it's literally the most shear thing I'll do a little drop and I'll rub it in and basically it doesn't really look like anything was there because you're facing nice hydrated look but at the same time I can use my skincare routine to give me the hydrated look however I do think that if you're looking for something that's very very light coverage this does help to dull down a little bit of your redness and inflammation with a concealer it's going to be very great for a lightweight skin dates but at the same time I don't think it's this is really worth the price
