pressedflowersss reviews Glossier Perfecting Skin Tint G5 is a warm deep shade 1 fl oz / 30 ml by Glossier: good morning guys I just wanted to walk you through some very natural lighting I used my glassy skin tight end for my complexion make-up today and I used my script concealer is there ghosts in the shade G11 I loved the coverage that I get it's very minimal very refreshing and then I used a cream powder highlighter winning with my gingerly MAC blush really like how the space looks today but a little bit of texture going on and never bothers me too much and then I just crawled my lashes all nice and I feel like I'm ready to take on the day and I find that this doesn't separate her look all crazy by the end of the day if you guys ever want like a good product I can't wait to try the Mac face and body I'm really looking forward to finally trying that I know they reformulated it they re change the name to Shear Radiance or something now that's just a Pander to younger
