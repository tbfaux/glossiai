nevibaby reviews Futuredew by Glossier: so I actually only had a sample of this product but I really really like it I used it about three times the sample was quite large and I really want to buy this like cuz the quarantine stuff happening right now I'm not going to but it is my birthday tomorrow and it's my 21st birthday and I have to spend it not with family and friends so that kind of sucks but maybe if I get some birthday money I will save it and then buy it when all this mess is over but I do really really like this oil serum hybrid I don't know how they did it but they did something like look glowy I look like my skin looks so healthy and nourished like also it smells really good and feels amazing I don't know how much it refills for is so I'm going to go check that out if anybody has any glossy a like discount thing is like we're like you're affiliated with ever whatever send them my way because I'll totally use it cuz I know that you also get a discount or whatever so
