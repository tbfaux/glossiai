katiestark reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: I literally haven't bought lotion in 5 years and I bought this on a whim and I feel like I can't live without it it comes out pretty sick but it Blends and your skin and just melt into it so quickly and has like a really nice Sheen to it that I like and it smells good but its not overpowering so I definitely recommend this if you're a lotion buff or you're into trying a new lotion and I didn't think it was that expensive so yeah
