khoang reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so the glossy stretch concealer I'm sure you've heard of it by now is really good for like light covers it's very reflective and like emollients and so it's under the eyes it's very soothing on cuz avocado moisturizing but it actually doesn't have but terrible covers like at Macy's like blemish black people say they don't like to use it for viruses cuz it is kind of chilly but I honestly don't mind I think I prefer that it's super easy to find out I just use my finger and you can like layered up and it's fine yeah I think they have some Flemish has a year and it covers it up fine without hiding your skin texture anything and doesn't like completely erase your flaws it just makes them like a lot less noticeable so it still looks very natural
