uninspired reviews Perfecting Skin Tint by Glossier: so I'm going to be talking about the glossier skin tint as well as applying it I'm in the shade G8 and currently I just have sunscreen on and the glossy to be a little bit difficult for me to apply this without my glasses on I just would have liked to go using my fingers to apply a lot of products but this one I definitely think is best applied with the fingers here is what my skin looks like it's just really Dewey and really natural and it looks like skin now this is an extremely light coverage skin tint I personally like just how it looks nice and makes my skin look over all yeah that's basically all I have to say about this product
