pergoddess reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so this is going to be on the glossier stretch concealer and mine is in the shade G4 I believe so I'm not sure if you can tell the difference but I've applied some on this side but not this and what I still do see like the cast of my dark circles it is a little bit more filled in and better-looking I can definitely say I didn't have any bad things to say about this besides them not have enough colorings that everyone could benefit from but I guess I was lucky and fell in between coloring pages or whatever but this is how it looks super moisturizing super hydrating as you can see it just melts right into my skin what is giving a dinner cuz I did just use that it's a pad but I didn't use it under my eyes so are you I just wanted to let you guys know about that
