Beautaf reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: and before you say anything I know I already reviewed this concealer but he's winning points today and I really needed to give them a shout out this is what I have on right now stretch concealer in medium but they came out with it you shaved today additional two they're four original shade so they now have 12 shades of stretch concealer and skin tint and I'm really sad about that because it's really important for Brands to be inclusive and I'm just happy because although they always like to represent different cultures and efficiencies on their website they always had a very diverse models now there's more shades for their customers to feel like okay maybe there's a shade in there for me because even though with the four Shades I think they worked for a lot of different complexions because of how sure they were now I feel like people are going to feel more comfortable to buy to let him by the stretch concealer as content because they don't feel like there's a shape for them
