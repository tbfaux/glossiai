ellessentially_ reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: this is my favorite mascara right now I know that there is a lot of people who don't like it and I'm also in the market to find it tube because I try not to buy from glossier a but I love it I like how tiny the brushes because my eyelashes are pretty long but my eyes are kind of small so I always end up getting mascara on my eyelids and I think it's like I don't mean huge clumpy lashes it's like the last thing I need what I just want is to accentuate what I have and make them visible what is this and it doesn't transfer anything which is really nice like using them on my lower flashlight as well
