FlauntFace reviews You, Solid Perfume by Glossier: he fought me on here to share with you a fragrance I have fallen in love with which I get really excited when I end up falling in love with the fragrance of it's not often that I get to but anyway I was able to try is fragrance from the liquid form via samples that were given to me purchasing at The Classy store so you do get it in this package in this really cute black yato and it comes in this box so we're going to undo everything that was a rubber band and then come to this Foam Guy with this plastic insert and then just pop it out this is actually quite heavy as well which is awesome so it'll be easy to find in your bag and a little tip I find it easy when the thumbprint is pointing up so just slide your finger that way so it's really easy to open and the solid form it comes with his little Q glassy a logo and you get a little baggie for it too so you haven't given us a try, it's amazing
