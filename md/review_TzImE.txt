lilyytay reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: classy bomb.com is definitely one of my favorite glossy products and my favorite lip balm of all time I have almost all the sense or flavors except for the Newberry one and original butt coconut is definitely my favorite it smells like a Beach vacation and I just I'm so obsessed with it this is my ranking from favorite to least favorite Cherry is my least favorite because it is a pretty strong artificial Cherry scent and it can just be overwhelming sometimes I just feel like it because it is tinted but I don't reach for it that often I really want to pick up the Newberry shade though because I feel like it's going to be in my top three
