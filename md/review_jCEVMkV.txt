carsonmakeup reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: say what your to t.j. Maxx is on the hunt for some glossy a I was quite successful I found these two lip glosses the shade of holographic so shimmery and lie to me it is clear from this partly also watch it on my hand and I got attacked by my little puppy but yeah it's just a nice clear glittery put this on top of anything and I'm such a nice touch. This red one and it is also very it is sheer it's not exactly Red Spot It yeah I figured out was really doesn't have much color but I think I'm too nice little Kim I don't know if I can even call that but I do love his glasses and I would buy them if you find them at t.j. Maxx or Marshalls
