naomiepp reviews Super Glow by Glossier: okay so I reviewed the glossy icing with low vitamin C serum a cup a couple weeks ago actually it might be a couple months ago by now either way I don't really know what it's supposed to do so I've been completely blessed with skin but does not have a lot of problems I have I'm a little bags with her own kind of dry butt acne some of it a problem dark spots it ever been a problem so I don't even know if it's worth me using this point being I haven't noticed a difference and I've been using it for a while now so it's not going to stop me from using it but it is something that I'm just kind of like sorry I already talked about how we're not supposed to do this anymore but I don't know I'm just going to keep using it see what happens so far let me know let me know
