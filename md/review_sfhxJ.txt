jules_r0se reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: this next one is the Cherry balm.com obviously I can stop by tonight and this is what the packaging looks like I really like what they do with the Cavs how they make it like a similar but different color they might this one is tinted it's a red tint I don't love the flavor of this one it reminds me a little bit of like I don't know it's a little too sweet for me but I really like the 10th it's a really nice sheer red tint so I use it when I want to feel you know a little more dressed up but still not super duper fancy
