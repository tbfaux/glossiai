amudaus reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: he was a guy so today I'm going to be reviewing didn't work out as planned to be reviewing the coconut balm.com so my first impression of this bomb.com was not good I thought it smelled really bad originally and then I went ahead and purchase it because I'd originally smelled it at the LA store and I bought it because I just wanted all of them and I actually really love the scent now the scent is like really sweet as a little bit of coconut but it's like kind of like vanilla and I really do like the scent when I want something a little bit more tropical I use this and it is becoming summertime and I'm definitely going to heavily use this and the mango one throughout the summer like every day
