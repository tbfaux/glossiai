clairewalter reviews Lidstar by Glossier: I want to show you guys what I have on my bottom lash line it's the glossier lidstar and Lily let's start comes in this little tube I think it's a quarter of an ounce and it has a doe foot applicator I'll show you the applicator I'm having a hard time getting my camera to focus on it I don't love lidstar on my eyelids because it creases on mine but I do have that natural Kris when I open my eyes so maybe it's just me I do like the texture and I love the colors I have been using it that you can see on my lower lash line just for a pop of color if it's Lily or I use van or another one of the darker color is if I'm going on at night I just I love how it adds color and if I put it under there than it doesn't crease I would do it for you guys but I just did it and accidentally deleted the segment you guys can see though
