lonnekemckinney reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello today I'm going to be reviewing declaw see a cloud paint in the shade storm I was very hesitant to try this as it is a very very dark color though I was able to get it to a light enough color to flatter my skin tone I only use a very small amount as you can see it does look nice on my skin tone and this could definitely last me a very long time it was about $18 I believe and I have a couple of these brushes and I absolutely love themthere is .33 oz in here but it'll definitely a while which is what I usually do and yeah I really like this stuff into watching
