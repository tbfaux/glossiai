GracieS reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: okay today we are talking about the glossies it stick so I usually don't get much acne but I have two pimples right now and I am not thrilled about it I got this 2 days ago and have been using it since and I've had two very different reactions so the zit above my lip went down immediately and redness and there was no bump but the zit on my cheek got a red circle around it which I thought was very unusual so I'm curious to see to hear what you guys think about who eat when you have it but based on the results of this is it I will definitely be using it again hope that this is not permanent and I will keep you guys updated on how the zit stick works for me
