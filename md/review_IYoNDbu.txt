AndreaIslas reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys so another project that I'm going to recommend you today is the glossier cloud paint in the shade puff and sza second one I've tried and I love it just because it keeps that I like very natural color it doesn't change much I will say at least in my skin color but I like it because like I said it looks very very natural I mean I used to have the I don't remember the name but it was more like a baritone and you was like very very intense and all of my friends will think that I was sunburned on my cheeks but now it's because it's very intense but this one it's a very very natural color so I will totally recommended
