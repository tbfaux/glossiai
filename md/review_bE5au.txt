sarah_novio reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: so to add to my skin care entities I have the glassy eyes that stick what I liked about the zit stick it was that not only did it reduce the size of an active pimple on my face but it also kept my skin pretty hydrated as well by not drying out my skin around the Pitbull at the same time is treating the spot that is a hectare and that's why I really really like this product
