allthatskincaress reviews Blade Sharpener by Glossier: so this is deep glossy play sharpener called played it's specifically meant to sharpen the color slides from glossy and it's supposed to be like a special German blade technology and it's like $4 I think when I first bought color side I did not think that play with or the blade was worth it because $4 for Sharp retire like I could get a 50 Cent sharpener butt after trying and buying a 50 Cent rapper dies and sharpening this with just normal pencil sharpeners I realized that it doesn't work nearly as well as this one does this one actually have been sent without breaking off the tip which is in sane. So if you're going to buy glossy a color slide I definitely recommend or actually like I think you might need this product cuz it's the only one that's compatible with the soft tip sharpening the soft tip
