unicorn520 reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: how everyone's so today I'll be reviewing the glossy gloss is just a really basic clear gloss so this is the applicator to pretty good size it's really moisturizing and I think it makes your lips look slightly bigger it's not sticky at all ends really comfortable to wear so I would definitely recommend this
