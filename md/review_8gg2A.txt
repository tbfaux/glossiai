Kylie reviews Colorslide by Glossier: hey guys so last for today I will be reviewing glossier's color slide in early girl because it is my favorite color right now it's like this green they described as like an eggshell blue but I feel like I kind of has a green like t hold to it which I really like I really like it with my brown eyes I did this so you can see kind of the coverage that I can get this is it with no primer and I really like it was super eaters use my finger and it's like eyeshadow and then you can do like these eyes on the other side if you wanted to I probably would for like a party or something but you can also make it really casual which I like a lot to I'm definitely going to be getting more colors of them but they're kind of expensive so I got to wait
