kaylchipbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: everyone so they're probably going to be reviewing today is the blush bomb from flower I have this in the shade pinched it is a cruelty free and vegan gel blush so I'll show you what it looks like on I'm going ahead and applying it it's got this great little squeezy tubes you can really get like just the right amount of product then I kind of warm it up in between my fingers apply it to the apples of my cheeks and just work on blending that in I think the color-blind look really seamlessly egg is that really nice Natural Glow it feels amazing on the face they are pretty expensive shade range life is like variations in their undertones I really like it I wear this one as my everyday it would be really good and hot weather especially if you could really hold up well I haven't tried the glass A Cloud paint but I have a feeling that this is kind of a similar like Natalie to look if that's what you're into I recommend this one
