norahwileyy reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: hi super great this is my review on the glossier priming moisturizer to my friend let me borrow this for two days I've been using it for two days morning and night I really adore the non-greasy formula but it still makes your skin dewy and plump and for me I have an oily T-Zone and everywhere else is normal and this does not clog up my pores what makes my normal skin like shein of course the packaging is just so aesthetic and gorgeous it would make a great vanity accessories so this is what it looks like and run then you can see that it is so moisturized and it just gives my skin a luminous effect whatever I was doing strizer I will definitely be repurchasing this product I mean I think you get your bang for your buck here so I recommend it
