lonnekemckinney reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hello today I'm going to be reviewing be glossy a bum.com right here I have it in the flavors Rose and coconut honestly Rose is probably my favorite just because it's very refreshing in my opinion it makes me feel like I'm in a day at the spa and I like the little bit of a pink tint against my lips as this one is tinted this one is just your clear bomb us a really like the taste of this one out feels like I'm at a tropical vacation there very moisturizing I can put this on the morning and I'll still feeling on at 2 in the afternoon so you don't have to reapply these a lot smell amazing they're relatively pricey but it's definitely worth
