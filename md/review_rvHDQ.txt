mikayla_rose_lynn reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: today I'm going to be testing out glossy is cloud paint this is in the shade beam it's a nice peachy pink color what I love about the splash is its consistency and blend ability into the skin it just is really seamless and it's a really beautiful color as well I think this is a product that would work well on a universal amount of skin tones if you see it just melts right into the skin I'm not wearing any makeup right now and it's just really beautiful really glowing you can use it up under the cheekbone for a nice Contour as well and I also like to add a little bit to my eyelids so classy Cloud paint
