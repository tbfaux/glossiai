elaineeverett4 reviews Hydrating Face Mask: Moisturizing Moon Mask by Glossier: I'm really loving the glossier moisturizing Moon mask a fuses so many times that is kind of the lettering falling off of used more than half of it it's very Cooling and it's great in the summer heat I live in Mississippi where it's really hot so this is a really good addition to my mask collection I'm going to show you how it looks on the inside for the texture it's really really creamy and it applies well on the skin it's a little goofy on the skin it stinks in really well and he know you wash it off with a warm washcloth and it works really well it's very very hydrating and cooling so I would recommend for sure
