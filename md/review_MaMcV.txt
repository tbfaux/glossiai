amourjnfr reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: play I'm reviewing the glossier boy brow in the shade van I've won the shed black Cleo but Brown I find works the best. I've had mine for a while and the packaging is very worn out but I like to add a few drops of Rosemary essential oil just to get all the product out I love the Pomade consistency and a small brush one makes it a lot easier to apply
