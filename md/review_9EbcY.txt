alliecoco reviews Generation G by Glossier: my favorite lipstick is Generation G from glassy 8in Crush the reason I like this particular lipstick is because it codes on sheer it's almost I could tint and I love the kind of cherry popsicle stain how did it gifts my only complaint is that the lipstick breaks off easily so maybe the component is not super well made but the color itself the application looks really nice on me I think also I think I got this about a year ago so glad they could have updated the components packaging components to make the product better I don't know but I love it
