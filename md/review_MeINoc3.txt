ellessentially_ reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: also I forgot to tell you I think G9 and for reference I think I'm like 190 in a Fenty foundation so that might help yes are you going to do is like a small stippling brush to really blend it out I've really fallen for stippling brush has recently I just want to show you how I put pick it up on my brush so you see I have a little I'll just like that right up on the edge and really just get like a small amount and apply that now with this I find I really have to powder afterwards because it's so creamy that if I just leave it as is on my skin especially if I wear a mask it's going to rub right off so I do like to powder a little bit too kind of set it and to keep it down because they sell a router so they kind of insinuate that you could be using them powder anyways I just do this area and a little down by my nose and that's about it
