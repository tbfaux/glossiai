stepstoglow reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: so there's only so much I can say in 60 seconds but this is C glassy-eyed Play gipp Glitter jelly and fire walk and I'm wearing out my eyes right now and it has potential it's pretty it's a beautiful color with pretty glitter as a cool bouncy formula but with a brush or with your finger I find that it's watches very chunky If This Were an eyeshadow we would be saying is chalky like it is for a powder the glitter is scratchy is not biodegradable and overall I feel like when I have is I look like the meme of the girl in a car seat with the purple eyeshadow this looks like kids makeup and for something that's too expensive and so bad for the environment I was very disappointed I think it did have potential but I'm not happy with how this looks here it is up close and personal
