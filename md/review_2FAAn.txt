Claire reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: hey guys I'm going to review the milky oil from bossy I got this through super great with my points so it was kind of free give it a good Shake I'm soaked this time bad queso the major claim to fame is that it's going to waterproof makeup I don't wear mock waterproof makeup so I can't help you there so it's just going to have to be in my regular makeup do this half of my face so it was pretty easy it took a lot off this has to have makeup this half doesn't he got all my mascara it's nice fine I don't think it's that great if I'm being honest I think probably really similar to this and more expensive I tried looking but it doesn't say anywhere if you're supposed to wash your face after you use this I'm going to just cuz it does feel like there's a film again it's a perfectly good makeup remover I just don't think it's anything new or that I've ever tried before
