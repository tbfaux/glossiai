tangomango reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: everyone at so I have this coconut balm to come from glossy a I love the one that comes their amazing I literally love every single one of them they're so nice but we're focusing specifically on the couch not one I love to use this one as like a like all over like I feel like with the tinted ones I can't like put on my nose right here because I don't want like a tent there but this is definitely one of the one of the one of the ones that I like to use on my other parts of my face like if I have a dry patch on the side of my nose hurt like always dry no matter what season it is but I just really love for God I don't really use this one that was on my lips because I'm not really that much of a fan of the sentiment but I really like this which is why I don't like the temperature if you do like coconut since this will be a great product for you and overall like people always complain about the price of this but honestly I think it's definitely worth it
