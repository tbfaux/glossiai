devinkielle reviews Skywash by Glossier: so I ran out of time in the last of you but as I was saying before I actually really like that go and I really like Tara again I want I go now but they do sometimes get to be a little patchy Echo not too much Tara I did see it get a little patchy on me but the other five Shades do not work for me or my skin complexion if they work for you great they don't work for me for 2 hours she's too chalky and way too patchy there's no like evenness across the eyelid at all when I applied the other Shades so I will definitely keep using Echo and Tara the other ones if you are a chocolate girl like me they're just not for us this
