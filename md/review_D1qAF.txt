_emilymarie reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: I'm currently doing my makeup so I figured I'd review this and show you how I use it at the same time so this is glossier stretch concealer I have it in late this is one of my favorite 2 concealers so I show you how I use it so I use this concealer with the Nars soft matte complete concealer and mix them together and what I love about the glass you can sealer is it gives a really good amount of coverage but it keeps your skin looking Dewey and like not dry or anyting so that's not covered with the to mix together it just has amazing like coverage and it's not expensive at all and it just looks good on the skin if you didn't set it would still be fine it wouldn't be too crazy I just love that it's Dewey and but at the same time it will work for oily skinI also love that you can use this as a concealer or Foundation if you use it all over
