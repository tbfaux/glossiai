clare0b reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: what is there to say about this product that has not already been said this is the glossy lip gloss in the shade clear and we love her we stand there is literally no downside to this lip gloss except maybe the price it's kind of pricey for just a clear gloss but I feel like it's worth it if it has a nice thick applicator that allows you to apply it really seamlessly it's smooth it lasts a really long time for a gloss like I don't have to reapply it during my retail shifts which is nice highly recommend I mean obviously
