isabellamjohn reviews Lidstar by Glossier: this is my glossy lid star I have it in the color cub and this person my favorite color that I have I think it's perfect for just a super like light coverage natural makeup look and then you can also layer it and then paired with a few other colors to make it more of like a going out or like nighttime look so this is it on I just use the little applicator wand thing to put it on and as you can tell I get the super sheer but like sparkly and pretty light pink color you can definitely Build It Up by adding more to make the color a little bit darker but just feel like every day I think this is super pretty and it gives a little bit of Sparkle
