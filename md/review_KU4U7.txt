mzudsiri reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: since I've basically already reviewed to other glossy makeup products today I figured I would just add to the look and review the cloud paint Duo you save $6 if you buy two I'm reviewing a the duo because I want to show you guys what it looks like when I miss when I mix Hayes and desk together to form a more natural Rosy color and I'm using the elf small stipple brush because that's my favorite brush when I use these products also your hands work but honestly the brush which is pretty cheap like less than three bucks worth it
