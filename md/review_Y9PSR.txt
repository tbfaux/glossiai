katiestark reviews Super Glow by Glossier: I have tried all of glossier's serums and I don't feel like they do that much for me and they're like a really really watery which is interesting it's like nice of you always can I guess it won't clog them but yeah they're like very very loyal or very very watery I like to use this if I do feel like using it in the morning because it doesn't make my skin oily for under makeup or anything but I'll take a drop out so you can see like literally how liquid it issay my hands dirty but little water it's so crazy I've never seen a serum like this before it was a good interest here am I guess but help acne one would do more for me they didn't really do much for me so
