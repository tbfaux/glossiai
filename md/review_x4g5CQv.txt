MyBeautyThesis reviews Skywash by Glossier: so the new glossy a Skywatch just came in the mail and I've been so excited to try this one it is in the shade Valley which is a warm Peach as described by so let me show you how it looks so here is the sky watch this I has nothing on it and I applied to layers on to the side so you can see that it's a nice sheer just kind of wash of color and it gives a really pretty base to the eye and then you can finish off by putting some liner or mascara and Call of Duty so it really does give just a really pretty kind of all over tent and it was super easy you just thought it on and blend it with your finger
