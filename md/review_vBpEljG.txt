lifewcourt reviews Wowder by Glossier: glossy as a router setting powder they call it the water which I think is like super cute this is what the inside looks like it has like a little nut and you can like dividend and like powder can come out and stuff I kind of feel like this Potter's like super underrated like I don't hear a lot of people talking about it but I really love it I love how like find the powder is it doesn't make you feel dry or powdery it just kind of like set your makeup so you're not feeling like sticky almost which I lovethey do have different shades as well for the powder so none of them are really like a translucent I find it doesn't give you any covered so don't worry about the shade is just more like a shade that would work for you so I feel lighter shade which is G11 to T12 so busy like a translucent powder for me they do have a brush that you can buy with it which I really want but I just use a big fluffy brush right now and it says I'm perfect
