sarah_novio reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: so so I could probably going to talk about is the glass a stretch concealer and I am the shade G5 so what I like about this product is similar to what I said about the skin tent which it allows you to get that really kind of skin like finish and also leaves kind of residue which I really like in my complexion routine and it just covers up a little bit more so you could do a little bit more detailing in your complexion
