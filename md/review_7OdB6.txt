lonnekemckinney reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello today I'm going to be reviewing the glossier cloud paint in the shade Haze I would describe this color as a raspberry pink I really like this because it is unlike any blushes I have and this is another one of the cloud paints that I was very like scared to get because of how dark it appears and it is very dark though I only need a little bit to get my desired effect as you can see I have he's right here but the clown pants are definitely my favorite thing from glossy a and if you want 10% off your purchase your first purchase then you can use my code which I will leave it in the comments or it is in my description but yeah I really like this you can get to Club pay $3 which is what I usually do cuz I believe that is really good to you but
