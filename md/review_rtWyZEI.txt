macyjy reviews Glossier Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream_8.4 fl oz / 250 m by Glossier: I forgot to send it to the song sounds exactly like the wash like straight up like jasmine tea pretty pretty thick but it rubs in really well and I love this as well I like to use my lotions most of the time when I get out of the shower cuz I come like locks in the more stir when your skin is still a little damp so this one coupled with the wash also helped like the scent stay on my skin all day my skin was super soft like I would definitely recommend getting the duo of the body wash and lotion
