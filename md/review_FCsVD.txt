hannahbeauty reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: so I am reviewing the glossier Play Glitter jelly and this is in the shade Phantasm so I was watching these at the glassy a store and I put a little bit of this on my cheekbones just like this and I fell in love with it I think this particular shade is really beautiful because it kind of sinks into your skin and disappears when the light isn't hitting your face and then like when you turn and that Sun hits you it really kind of jumps out so this is beautiful for a festival for going out at night I think it's a really cool personal products I put a little bit on my eyes to the only thing is of course for most people the facial glitter is not like an everyday thing so you have to be able to justify the cost and how much you'll actually use it but I've Gotten Good use out of this I find it it's easy to apply I like the little detailer brush that it comes with so I would highly recommend this product
