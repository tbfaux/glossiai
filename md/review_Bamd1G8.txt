allthedew reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: hello everyone today we're going to be talking about the glossy gloss this is one of my favorite lip glosses and I'm obsessed with someone they came out with like the red in the shimmery one ice pick him up because the original it's just the most wet juicy Looking-Glass it's amazing I really love is at every day releases like on a holiday set like years ago and it did so well they kept it. I think it was originally supposed to be like limited edition and they came out with these two so I really love the right I'm wearing right now on top of a red lip butt let me show you how it looks without being over anytingso the first one is the clear one and it's just the most wet I mean come on then the next one is a shimmery one it has like some pinky shimmers some gold and pink it's a really nice and then this is red which is nothing to be afraid of it's a really light sheer red
