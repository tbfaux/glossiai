ninii reviews Colorslide by Glossier: hey guys before Christmas I got some of these glossy eye color slides and shade critical mass jumbo and early girl and I cannot wait to play with them okay can we just talk about how cute this is the blade comes with the cleaning stick so cute okay so I think I'm going to start by doing a pop of the color critical mass they're super creamy and blendable especially if you already have a cream product on the eyes right now I have a little bit of cream bronzer on my eye so I'm just going to do a little of this color I love how subtle it is but you can tell it's there it's beautiful there really buildable to I played with Early Girl yesterday so I use a little bit of jumbo on the waterline I want every single color now
