skincare_obsessed_ reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: no I also wanted to come on here and talk about my Holy Grail blush now this is the cloud paint blushes buy glossier I own two shades lighter shade puff which is this lovely little pink and then I also own it and shade storm which is this more darker deep color and this is I think a really great wintry blush and this is a beautiful summer one and I don't have any other makeup on right now so I'm just going to show you guys how really natural this looks when applied it's going to take a little bit and you really only need a little product and then you just dab a little bit on and you blend it outand it's super buildable and nice and it just looks so natural so pretty I absolutely loved it and if you want anyone if you ever want more you can build it and apply more so easily just look at that super cute super quick super
