tru_beauty reviews Solution by Glossier: please I'm going to review another glossy you product cuz I'm obsessed with this brand okay I heard people raving like crazy about this product and I'm kind of in the middle of using it now so I can't really say that I have results yet so I'm kind of skeptical so when I was looking at the ingredients I was just like what it's literally just a salicylic acid treatment like you can get that at Walgreens or anywhere else but it's also packed with all these good stuff too so maybe this is worth getting just got a flat nozzle where you take a cotton pad and slowly pressdo pumps in to get the product on there and you Pat not swipe on your face it smells really gross how to lose a tingly feeling and dry sticky some of my scars have been going away but very slowly I am a Mexican has gotten much softer though because it is a chemical exfoliator
