peneloqe reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: this is the glossier Milky jelly cleanser I highly recommend this because it is one of my Holy Grail products for a reason it's very gentle on your skin and it removes makeup pretty well it removes my mascara and I love it so much it also has helped with texture and kind of moved it a little bit I do not know how this would be on acne-prone skin but it's great for maintaining good skin
