gracie_mae_1515 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I'm going to be reviewing them down. Comes in mango Berry birthday mint and coconut coconut mint birthday and barrier like really solid they're very good they smell good this one is super attended compared to this one that's supposed to be like in Orange and the packaging is really cute at the thick consistency for the lip balm It Last Forever they are $12 a piece but I did 23430 things you save $6 I definitely highly recommend themso yeah you should totally get these I do think that if you don't like mango scented things or flavored things don't buy the mango that's my lovely little PSA kind of deal the original is also on Sunday
