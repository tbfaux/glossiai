chai reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello so I'm going to be reviewing the teks line by freck it's in the shade fielding and I got these as a super great reward I'm going to be applying the smallest drop Like This is the final result I think it looks very natural very pretty and I think it would work with different complexions and it's really easy to blend so I would recommend it I want to make a quick comparison between the cheek slime and the glossier cloud Paint & Dawn they're similar but the cheek slime is a little darker
