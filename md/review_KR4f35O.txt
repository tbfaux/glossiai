fourteencarrot reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: another Holy Grail of mine this is the glossier boy brow in clear and I use this with my blond eyebrow brush for eyebrow pencil which is also empty and then I go in with my clear and I just give my brows a little bit more definition with the clear boy brow I also love the blond one but I've really been using this clear one with the pencil more often and I love it pro tip if you find you're getting too much product on the little baby sleepwhen you take it out of the tube go ahead and brush it on the sides like so to get off any excess product and this will last you a little bit longer so pro-temp with a boy brow I love it I've already repurchase anyone so Holy Grail
