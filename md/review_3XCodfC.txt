sodapantsss reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: time to throw on some mascara so why not lash slick I've had this tube of glasses lash slick for probably too long but it's one of the few mascaras I truly enjoy as a spray for sensitive eyes like mine and it's not it's like in my lashes but better just like their brow products are it's a nylon brush to so it's really good at grabbing every Lash so let's try it out so it's super pretty and subtle grade for everyday it doesn't curl unfortunately but it just kind of adds a little tint just like their boy brought us overall I really do enjoy it it's only 16 bucks so it's not crazy expensive and unscented and great for my eyes
