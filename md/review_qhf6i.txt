dinamamnev reviews Generation G by Glossier: hey so I wanted to make a really quick review on the glossy a generation G lipstick in the shade Leo so this is like one of the best products it gives like a perfectly blotted look it doesn't look like overly like it doesn't look like you have like seriously stuck on it just almost makes your lips look like a beautiful just natural looking color which I have been looking for it for so long and I finally found it in this so this is my lifestyle anyting and after putting it on so that's what it looks like it's like very sheer but like perfect also so I love this stuff
