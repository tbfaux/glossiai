Bmak0324 reviews Mask Duo by Glossier: so right before this I did a review on the mega greens Galaxy detoxifying mask and now this is there I guess partner you could say in this is a moisturizing Moon mask is a soothing face treatment which they work great together because the detox mask makes my face super red and kind of hot but then I put this one right after and I absolutely love it this smells so refreshing also I mean packaging come on so cute but this was so refreshing we both last forever I think you can give them both for like thirty $40 I could be totally wrong on that though so I would double check for you by but yeah I am obsessed with this
