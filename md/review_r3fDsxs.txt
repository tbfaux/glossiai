thatgoodglow reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so the first product that I have to review for you guys today is the glossier cloud paint I only have the two shades on this is dusk in this is Hayes and I really like these as someone who doesn't wear a ton of makeup you will need to tiny bit like maybe a. Half the size of your pinky nail and it it's good for both cheeks they're very pigmented very natural-looking and you don't need any kind of base on you can put it on bare skin or just on primer or sunscreen or whatever you have and they look awesome this is really pretty if you have a tan or if you have a deeper skin tone my friends with darker skin look beautiful in this and this kind of just makes you look like you have a sun kissed glow it's very beautiful for the season I really like this one right now for spring on this one I know is going to be a go to in the summer so yeah these are the clock see a glass case
