beautybymonamarie reviews Generation G by Glossier: this is a glossier generation G and the sheet cake it's a subtle peach color with a matte finish and a blotted lip effect here's how it looks on me it's cruelty-free vegan paraben-free hypoallergenic allergy tested and dermatologist tested it is like a balmy texture it's not incredibly moisturizing but it's not drying either it's just very very pretty you could build up the opacity by adding layers or just wear it sheer okay so I just built up the color a little bit more it doesn't have a flavor but it does have a very mild row sense
