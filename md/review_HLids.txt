bellamarie reviews Mask Duo by Glossier: okay so this is the second time I've used this mask it's me classy a mega greens Galaxy Pack it's a detoxifying mask and I like it cuz it's really light and it doesn't burn like a lot of other detoxing masks and so use that for 20 minutes I'm going to wash this off and put on the moisturizing Moon mask so I just watched the moon mask off and this is also the second time with me using it I like them usable together because first you get your face cleaned and then wish her eyes and then after I just wash it off I followed up with a moisturizer and my face feels very soft and very clean
