maryfox04 reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: okay so I'm going to review bees lip balm.com by glossy and I just got these literally 2 seconds ago so I haven't tried them all I did try the coconut so I got coconut Rose and mint I love monastic so that's why I got that but I tried to coconut and I really like how it smells but I'm not a fan as much as I think I would like these I think I like these more but still good I really like how big it is it has a lot of product in it I feel like they're one so you don't have to reapply like whatever they like so I recommend getting these if youif you want I mean there's not there's Chopsticks out there that are on expensive these are kind of on the more expensive side but I just thought I'd try him out and a lot of product and very moisturizing and cute packaging some I'd recommend for sure
