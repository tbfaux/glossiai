_emilymarie reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: so it's no secret that this is the best cleanser in the world I have this whole Bucket Full Bucket whatever full cleansers and this is the one you use constantly just witches use texture it's amazing also the best texture ever it's so like milky and creamy and hydrating and never strips my skin it takes off my makeup mascara everything it takes it off in one go it's just the perfect cleanser I recommend using this on dry skin and that kind of melts the makeup off and then add water and your makeup is gone in like 5 Seconds not to mention it's super expensive and even though it's 6 only 6 ounces I feel like I could use this a million times and it never runs out just kind of magic
