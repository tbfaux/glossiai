dewyinthedesert reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hi guys today I'm doing a review on glossier's stretch concealer this is what it looks like mine is pretty well loved and you have to get back up soon I have the shades light it does come in five Shades I hope they come out with more shades soon cuz it's not the best shade range so to show you how I use it I usually just tap it under my eyes and then blend it with a brush I also use concealer over any spots that I have I find that you can also blend it in with your fingers pretty well I usually do it with a brush but it does syncing nicely with the heat of your fingers it's a really good everyday concealer it doesn't clean to dry patches on this is the one that I use every day and I really enjoy it over all I would really recommend it this is the final look with concealer and thanks for watching
