abooogie_ reviews Vinylic Lip by Glossier: I picked up another vanilla clip from Gloucester play in the shape bank I reviewed this already I have some the shade baby but just to emphasis on the brush on this it's a nice fluffy brush super easy to apply has the clicker back here to bring up the color and this specific brush it's so easy to use to line your lips and color payoff is gorgeous look at this I mean do not so pretty as you can see it is high shine again this is a color bank so it's kind of like a burgundy color super shiny not long wearing so you will need to reapply but it's not trying and it's a gorgeous pay off and it feels super moisturizing I love it guys you should really go
