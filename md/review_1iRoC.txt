martinabh reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: today I want to review glossier Cloud paint in Haze so you might be the Killer Instinct like no way it's going to be way too bright and I can't pull it off but trust me you can hear is the Swatch just on my hand and I'm going to rub it in and it's kind of this like warm Berry flushed color can you help really alive by love that it gives you kind of fact right healthy glow and it's really easy to use because it is a cream so I usually just got a couple on my cheeks flushed and I definitely recommend a quick flush you can wear any day and don't let the color scare you
