katie3281 reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so they're probably about a hundred reviews on this but I've been wanting it for a really really really long time and I finally got it and I just put it on and wearing it right now and I really like it I like the way it looks on my lips it's it's kind of sticky it which I heard of it wasn't which kind of annoys me that it is but I think it looks great and I've I've just been wanting a clear gloss for so long that I don't even care so if you're like me and like clear lip gloss I would definitely give the glossier lip gloss to try
