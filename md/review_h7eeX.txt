sarahjgomez reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: hey guys so right here I have be glossy Super bounce as I stated in my previous review over the glossy pure I was gifted all three of the super sperm glossier's that's really nice of him to send me that I absolutely I don't ride the super pure but this is really nice that has hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 serum I'm not dry skin but hyaluronic acid is one of my favorite skincare ingredients so I've been using us a lot and I've definitely been noticing a difference in just like my skin not healing oil e but more hydrated in about the week or so that I've been using these I absolutely adore these either $20 by themselves or 65 for all three of these I definitely recommend you guys go check these out they just relaunched these with double the product that they had before
