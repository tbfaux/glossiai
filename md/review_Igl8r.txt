abooogie_ reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: next I'm going to go in with some lash slick am I love this mascara because it's long-wearing but it doesn't get ugly clumpy or flaky and super easy to remove I soon as I get home I took me to wash my face right away because it's hot and I just need to get everything off and it's a super easy to take off and that's what I love about it so that's what I go in with nextjust a gorgeous lift and like I said I can read this all day and it doesn't get ugly or flaky or Messi
