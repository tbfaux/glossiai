speezy reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: so I have this in the shade Brown I just applied it actually on to this side cleaned it up with this I will use this images of blue Tacoma. I mean like punishing you have been there once you apply it just go crazy with that have fun you can leave it messy if you like I might like to take a small concealer brush like this and I go and I just clean up the edges but I'll show you again I was thinking about getting black but honestly I'm really glad I did get brown I have really dark brown hair but black is just I don't think it would be suitable for my face she can leave it however you want it and
