skincarehoney reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hello everyone to celebrate the opening of glasses new flagship store I thought I would talk about one of my all-time favorite glassy products which as you can obviously see it is cloud paint I know you see this everywhere but I assure you it's because they're perfect they totally deserve the hype that they have I never have an issue blending them out with my fingers with a brush with the sponge it doesn't matter they always lend out like a dream so on my hand I have put out the color of the clouds that looks like as well as they are Blended out shades on top I have storm which is a really pretty red brown color in the middle I have being witches are gorgeous orange Peach and on the bottom I have dusk which is a neutral brownish pink I probably used dusk out of all of them the most even though I am pretty fair but I do love all of them and I love mixing all the shapes together
