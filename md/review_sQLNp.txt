beautybymonamarie reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: glossier lash slick mascara is a fantastic daytime mascara let me show you it's a very lengthening and not so volumizing but it does separate the lashes very well I have the Teeny tiniest flashes but this just gives them a perfect little boost of the whatever I wanted to look like in the daytimeagain little man it just makes my natural eyelashes look so much better without appearing too overdone you know what I mean I really like it oh and my favorite thing is that it does not like smudge or play throughout the day but when I want to take it off I just add a little bit of warm water and like they slide off like little eyelash socks it's so cool
