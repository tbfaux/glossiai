lilytree reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: how about today at also share with you guys when I'm wearing on my cheeks as a blush I'm not wearing my regular rare reddblush that I have since I'm wearing an orange e colored lipstick I thought I'd go monochromatic today I'm wearing the glossier cloud paint and it's gone so it's an orange colors you can see and I loved it another great choice for warm skin tones like kind of peachy coralee orange Vibe on which I love so the color is definitely a win glossier Cloud paint in general is okay for a queen Bluffs the first English I tried so I loved it when I tried it but I didn't realize there were options out there that that were a little more long-lasting this won't last all day maybe half the day so I don't like it's lasting power to be honest but the color option is wonderful and you can't find this kind of color everywhere with cream blushes
