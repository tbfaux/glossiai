springmist reviews The Makeup Set by Glossier: Harvey Weinstein going to be reviewing the makeup set from glossier this makeup set includes a boy brow and you can choose it in the color of your brows then there's this mascara and then the splash you can also choose the colors of I'm going to start off with this blush I really like this liquid blush and they gave you I believe three or four options of the blush color you want I chose the lightest one since I've pretty pale skin and I definitely recommend this product next I have this mascara is mascara is a really good if you like more of the clumpy look I would not recommend this one but I like the more natural look so it makes your eyelashes look very long but it's not clumpy which I like okay the next product is as boy brow all you do is open it and apply it I don't really have any complaints but the fact that it is very tiny this how it looks like and I would definitely recommend
