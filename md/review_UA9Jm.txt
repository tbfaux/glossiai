bodybeauty reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey buddy be besties today I'm going to be reviewing the glass at a mango bomb.com so today I am at the beach so it's only fitting that I will be reviewing the Amigo flavor so this is the packaging and of course it looks super cute so this is what it looks like Swatch skin is like a coral color and the texture like Vaseline it moisturizes the lips and it adds a shine okay so now that I'm ride the Manga version I absolutely love I think this one and the Cherry balm.com are my favorite flavors it's sort of smells and tastes like the Hi-Chew mango with everyone says but it's so true in fact this one's actually not mind if I sisters but I'm definitely going to be buying one of my own
