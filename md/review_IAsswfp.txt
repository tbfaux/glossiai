mariskaa reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: so this is the glossier priming moisturizer rich I love this like this is like my favorite cream like that ever I have a lot of moisturizers but this is probably my favorite night time when it smells so good it smells like lavender but it's not like an overpowering henna smell so if your skin is sensitive to fragrance I don't think I'd recommend these or this not because I don't know what else I'm talking about but it is super thick and nice in a little goes a long way and it just it doesn't even though it's thicken hydrating it does not leave like a greasy or oily like cast or anything like that like I can use this in the morning and my face would just feel nice like you don't have it only use it in the night time and this is $35 so it's not likecheap but it's not like expensive and I think it's so worth it though like you need to get your hands on
