abigailrena reviews Skywash by Glossier: I'm not in the office today but I do have glossier's new liquid eyeshadow called Sky wash this is in the shade Pebble it's like a topi pink color I took a shame because I thought I liked being the one the Payless people in the office at this might be the best shade for me and then Vice watch it like it looks really really pretty and I kind of topi but then I put it on my eyelid and blended it out just like I said to do in the on the box and this is how it turned out on this is naked and as you can see there's not much of a difference I guess it is staying true to the glossy a no makeup makeup look but for me if I'm going to put in the effort put on eyeshadow then I want you to be able to tell that I'm wearing eyeshadow so this just isn't for me
