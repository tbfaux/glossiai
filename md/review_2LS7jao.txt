christaallen reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: glossier lash slick mascara here's a close-up look at the wand I don't understand how glass is used to make products that feel unlike any other products out there and if you've been doing makeup for you since you were little you've probably tried a lot of men really does feel different mascara for volume it definitely doesn't separate each lash and kind of bring them all out its it's more for if you want to really settle natural look I would say it's not for length either but the best part about it is so my eyelashes tend to touch up here and transfer by the end of the day
