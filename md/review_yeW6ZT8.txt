mimosa reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: this is glossier cloud paint in the shade puff it's probably my favorite other than being in this is Sasquatch of what it looks like even though it looks kind of cool tone on the website I'd say it's pretty neutral I have warm undertones and it looks great on me so this is how I apply it I just put it on my finger and then I tap tap tap tap tap my fingers a little goes a long way sometimes I go a bit overboard because I put a bit too much on but it honestly depends on the look you're going for sometimes I'll even put it on my eyelids to have a monochromatic look and it honestly just depends on the placement kind of hard to do great application looking on my phone but it's really pigmented but it's pretty sheer play me and must have
