nataliechen reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: yes it did I'm going to be talking to you guys but my two favorite blushes I've never really been one for powdered brushes that I feel like they just make me look at she so I absolutely love Liquid Plus this one definitely looks familiar to you guys is he glossier Cloud Paint & puff which is my favorite shade my only problem is it is that I don't love the package it whenever I squeeze a little bit of time comes out and it just feels like such a waste anyway the supplies super seamlessly and I absolutely love the way it just makes my face and she took more youthful not as many people know this one but it is super underrated can get this at Target but it's from the brand new moon mean and it's their watercolour blush I love how it comes in this your bottle all I have to do is drop it on my face and apply it or just a bit on my face and again I just love how it looks there's basically no difference in the texture of these two so you can almost say that this one is a tube of the glosses 81
