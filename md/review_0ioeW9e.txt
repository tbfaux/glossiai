casghar reviews Generation G by Glossier: all right so I just wanted to review glossier generation G lip color using natural brown color it's the perfect color I love it so much I feel like I want to wear it every day for every occasion yeah it just works so well for my skin tone I think so I'll show you a little bit of that alright so so you can come just do like one so if you wanted to be kind of light or you can layer it on to make it darker which is also a super cute depending on how you feeling I love this so I makes me sad that no one sees under eye mask is like the perfect color I would definitely recommend people try it's also like a nice kind of moisture level and pretty Mouse I like so yeah
