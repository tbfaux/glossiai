bellamarie reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey guys so I'm going to review the glossier Milky jelly cleanser I got this in the smaller size just to test it out I didn't know if I would like it so once I run out maybe I'll be purchasing a larger size cuz I do really like it it is a conditioning face wash so it leaves your face feeling really soft afterwards not like stripped or dry or stiff or anything like that from really like harsh face washes and it's also totally fine for sensitive skin I have sensitive skin in mind does not react at all to it this also is a sudsy so it's not going to like get all in your hairline and stuff so yeah I really like this product
