howdoyouglow reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: this was a little review of the glossier stretch concealer so I used to really like this product I thought it was nice but then when I started really using it I was like I feel like it just it doesn't provide any coverage and to me for however much it is I think maybe like 20 something or 18 it's just too much cuz it Doesn't provide anything so doesn't really do anything to my under eyes or like any bonuses it doesn't cover them so to me I'm just putting nothing on my face and it's a waste of time I also don't like how it's in a pot becauseit gets really dirty really easily so not really a fan this is in shade medium but yeah I think there are better concealers out there for cheaper at the drugstore even light ones
