Elizaepp reviews Solution by Glossier: hello everyone today I'm going to breathe doing a little bit of a new products that I got and this is the glossy a exfoliating skin perfector solution to this stuff is a salicylic acid acne treatment okay so my first impressions right when I got this is the smell it has a very strong chemical smell and because of that it will dry out your face a lot and so I usually use this about every other day to every 3 days and the packaging like all glass hair products is super cute and hurry use it is that it has this little pump that you can put a cotton pad on and push it down and then I'll usually put it on my nose and on top of my forehead since it does dry out your skin I tend to always follow it up with a moisturizer since I've been using this I've seen a lot of the tone in my skin really even out and I really enjoy this product
