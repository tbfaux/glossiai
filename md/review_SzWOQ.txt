mnsenese reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: so tonight I'm going to be reviewing my glossy a Milky jelly cleanser it is a face wash that takes you are SPF your makeup if you have a lot of pollution in your city or removed as well I love this product it's Adele consistency that when you add water to it it turns into a milk I love it for dry skin I love it for a wet skin I use in the shower I use out of the shower it removed everything from your face absolutely everything under with a pump descent islike a floral Affair I think it's grown but it's not strong at all I can't do highly fragranced products on my skin it breaks me out but this product is not breaking me out at all it's such a good overall cleanser for anything from makeup Revolution for SPS for cleansing your face in the morning is great amazing amazing
