JayciNicole reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hi guys so today going to be reviewing the glossy a face wash that's called milky jelly cleanser so right now I have on just my leftover face makeup through the day I washed off and ask her already cuz I don't ever use a face wash to do that one pump all right so I washed it all off with cold water and a washcloth and my face feels great it's always super soft afterwards I don't use a lot of face washes normally cuz I have pretty sensitive skin but this is never given me breakouts always makes me feel extra clean and I wanted to show you guys with a white piece of toilet paper how much it took off to does a pretty good job on foundation so you guys love face washes I would recommend this product hope you guys liked it please leave comments things
