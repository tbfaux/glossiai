Maloryhine reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: tutelary testing out the glossier cloud paint I have in the color puff which is just a light pink I just put a little on my finger David then I get a brush and Splendid in Just Cause the super light pink color that looks really natural I really like this color so I finish up my makeup now this product I use every single day it's in my daily makeup routine I love it it's super light but it's also super buildable so if you want it darker you definitely can make it darker I prefer to do it more natural so I only do like one layer but as I said it's super buildable I highly recommend this product
