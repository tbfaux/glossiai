hanahhdnd reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: I love the glossy a cherry balm.com it had a very like sheer red tint and I love the scent and it was very moisturizing but one of the problems I had is the applicator is kind of inconvenient because you just squirt it onto your finger like your fruit finger can be quite dirty from touching a lot of stuff that's my only problem but other than that I love it
