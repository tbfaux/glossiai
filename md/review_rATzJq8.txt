megmcsharryblog reviews Super Pure by Glossier: hey guys so I just wanted to do a quick review about glossier super pure niacinamide and zinc serum this is by far my favorite and I acting and sort of anti pore serum I've also tried good molecules and I didn't feel like it really did much for me at all this one definitely keeps my skin Clean and Free of breakouts on it's very lightweight it's almost feels like water on the skin and since they updated the formula to pack a figure and you get more for the price definitely recommend
