mollia716 reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: now I'll be reviewing glossy stretch concealer so I have this in the shade medium there's three Shades and this is what the shape looks like so I rub a little bit on my finger and then I start to apply so I think this formula blondes really well and it works really nicely for my skin because it's it kind of doesn't cake on and it Blends well so I would give this five out of five stars
