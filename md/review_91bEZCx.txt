thatgoodglow reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: so the Ecclesia is Dead stick is something I use towards the end of my arm skin care routine so I do really like this product it's 5% what is it benzoyl peroxide which is kind of an acne medication and what I usually do is I can I take off the other things I have on my problematic areas and then you have to twist the bottom and the product comes out at the top and then I just kind of dab it on the area's I need and then I will roll it into the skin but I will say is that this is only 5% so if you have a really bad spots there is another really good price there are lots that have 10% and I really like those this is not a solution for acne this is if you have minor break out areas so this isn't a cure but I do really enjoy
