WakeupMakeup reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: have you use okay it's so I know I've done a review on this in the past in case you've watched all my reviews but I wanted to just go over it again because it's down to the last literally it's completely empty I just wanted to tell you how amazing this stuff is if you've not tried glossier's priming moisturizer Rich it's a luxurious face cream it's just truly amazing I literally like I said I used it to the very last drop it makes your face just feels so moist her eyes and so amazing I highly recommend this I actually would mix it with my tanning drops and put it on my face it was just a great moisturizer to also add to the the Island Tanning drop but I highly recommend this time it is a little pricey but it is a great product especially for the winter time so just definitely definitely check it out if you've never had highly highly recommend
