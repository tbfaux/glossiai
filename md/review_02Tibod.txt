lifewcourt reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: continue with the Wonder. 5 minute makeup challenge I'm going to be going with my glasses directions healer as like my all over base that's like the only bass part I don't have I made a video about this before I truly love the stretch concealer it is a concealer but it like goes amazing on your whole face and it burns out amazing to this is so hard I don't know how people are doing this it's also really hard to do your makeup and your phone I've never done that before I think that's good I chose to use this because I could just give me that Chloe look so just continuing with that whole glow look
