beautybymonamarie reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: the glossier stretch concealer I did a face mask last night and my skin is looking good so today is going to be a classy AJ I'm already wearing the perfecting skin tint which I did a review on prior to this and now I'll show you the stretch concealer so just use it on the side of my face I just brightened up my dark circles and covered a little redness around my nose but the finish of this concealer is so beautiful it's very fresh it is do we so it'll give hydration underneath the eyes it's not as thick as the IT Cosmetics bye bye under eye that was a little too thick for me but I really like this I don't set it with powder because I like the finish on its own if it creases I just tap it
