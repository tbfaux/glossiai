Smash13 reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hey guys so I'm going to be reviewing the glossier lidstar in the shade Moon, super pretty from the outside from the packaging I love the little test tube like fish thing going on here it's really pretty so yeah this will be good for just like a little everyday kind of you know eyeshadow just oh I need to go run some errands or oh I just have a short day and I don't want to put on the full day and make up whatever Billy this would be really good for that but I did just put it on my eyes and it's not the best color payoff I feel like I had to keep on building a building a building at still didn't really get to where I wanted it to be you but maybe it's just a shade I might try like one more shade but whenever I do that I'll let you know as of right now I was a 3 out of 5
