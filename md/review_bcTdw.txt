AndreaIslas reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: this is the first time I hate a skin product this one it's supposed to be a spot treatment for your pimples and what it did to me actually left a burn mark on my people instead of helping me it actually looked worse so it's a no for me I have to say I don't have a sensitive skin so I was surprised that it cause such damage on my skin and it has really bad reviews on the glossier pageI did the mistake of never returning it so I just got stuck with this but I don't know guys do should be careful with this if it works for you then drape but just be careful with this subject strong I think no
