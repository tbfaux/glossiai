kelseylynne reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: so this is the glossier priming moisturizer and I'm not going to lie this product has really grown on me when I first got it I wasn't a huge fan but as I mix it with some of my other facial oils it really does a good job of keeping my skin hydrated but with not too thick of a solution since I've use this product on and off since I've gotten it it has like I said I really long time but yeah I really like it it's really light it's good for putting make-up over and just going on your daily activities does it make your skin greasy not too thick perfect consistency only thing is it smells a little weird like a little granny ish but other than that 10 out of 10
