butterandbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: okay another one of the original for this is beam which is a soft Peach I like this because with as it's as I mentioned with Dawn orange colors are very hard for me and this one again this is like blanket out you can barely even see it just the capture to the camera and this is it more saturated obviously it's all so like I was saying. Puff is not quite as different assome of the other Shades but this one I find to be the best multi-purpose like this one aside from dust which is coming next this is my favorite to carry around on the phone I can use it let size cheap you see it all right like it the restaurant okay so yeah this is another one that's not my picking it up here but it is just as nice natural Wharf
