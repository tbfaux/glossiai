__bellabeautyy reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: slipper clutch we're going to be diving into is the pink shade is called Angelic so it has basically identical packaging to the cloud paint and I'm just going to take a tiny little bit on my hands not much you really do not need a lot and this is what the color looks like how gorgeous so I'm going to just blend that out a bit we just screw the cat back on and this is what the shade Angelic looks like so Blended out it does look very beautiful and you can see the difference so even though it's cream and it can be shared out very well you do see that it is a very beautiful pinky color I'm pretty sure the pink color for glossy puffer something and I definitely feel like this is almost the exact same same shape color
