nataliexo8 reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hi guys I'm going to be reviewing glass AIDS lidstar and Lily I'm wearing it right now is both eyeshadow and highlight it's naturally and eyeshadow but I like it for highlight as well this is the applicator it's kind of large I just do a couple little thoughts and then I blend in with my finger it's really easy application this is my favorite purple Shadow usually purple Shadows look kind of brusie on my pale skin but this looks really bright and shear and lavender I wish it did have a little bit more pigment you can like kind of layer the Lyrid up but I feel that once you do that it kind of gets patchy and doesn't like kindstay a smooth consistency but it's still very easy for everyday eyeshadow it takes like no time to put on and it looks good without really any effort so I definitely recommend
