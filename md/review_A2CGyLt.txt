alaiyabijou reviews Generation G by Glossier: this is the glossier Jenny Our Generation G in the shade like I can't tell you I've tried all the other sheets and this one is the best one I love the generation G cuz it's so creamy it's so subtle but it's also mad and it barely looks like you're wearing anything this color is just absolutely gorgeous and you can top it off with the lip gloss from glossier the which really tops it off just apply that top and it's literally The Perfect combo for an everyday lip this is like a purple a color I can't watch it again on my hand this is like if you put high intensity this is if you put medium and this is only if you want like like you can always build this color up as you can see sometimes I really want to go super dark but I don't have a really dark purple so you can like so but a few times and got this really pretty color you can also use it as a blush and it works exactly
