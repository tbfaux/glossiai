hannahbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: so this is one of my favorite favorite products this is from the brand laca & Co and it's called the be lighter and it's a blush highlighter cream combo and I have it in the shade pictures. Which is this beautiful bright Peach and it has some Shimmer in it too so the bigger size of a full size retails for $17 on their website and I really think it's a beautiful product to wear for days when you don't want to put a lot of makeup on but you still want your face to have kind of like that kind of peachy glow with a little bit of a Sheen to it I really really like how blendable this product is I usually use it by just taking my finger and kind of like rubbing it in it and I usually put it over foundation on before I said it with powder and then I just kind of sat my whole face afterwards and I find that this is so easy to blend it like for me it Blends even easier than like the glossier cloud paint and it just gives you this beautiful beautiful finish so I'm a huge fan of this product this was kind of a fun Discovery for
