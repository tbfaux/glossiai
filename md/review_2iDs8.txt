bound2glo reviews Glossier You Perfume Solid fragrance compact and Glossier You eau de parfum by Glossier: I'm going to review the glossier You perfume this is my second bottle and that should let you know that I'm obsessed with it the packaging is self I love going to take it out and then spray and talk about the Sun what I love about the bottle is that I had this indentation for your thumb when you're spraying it so it just really feel personalized and like it's your own scent I'm extra so I spray it everywhere so I do likeand then I just let it fall over me what I love about this scent is that it has an overall like blanket tone of like a very light aromatic a little bit of floral but it combines with your natural scent like your natural body musk to really be like a signature scent for you and this has been mine for a year so a hundred percent recommend
