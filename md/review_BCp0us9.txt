CelesteDivinity reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: so I've had approached it for probably like 3 weeks now, and I haven't seen any reviews on it so I figured I would talk sexually a really wonderful eyeliner I do find it dries out at points but if you're frustrated and just be kind of like work off any of the excess it's really really a lovely gives nice folks lines and goes like super thin or for your securities how anyone is thicker when it really does to Justice I definitely try it out if you haven't cuz it's one of my favorites
