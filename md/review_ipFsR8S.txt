gabil reviews Futuredew by Glossier: this is the glossy a future do oil serum hybrid the packaging is one of the prettiest I've ever seen and I really love it it's very sleek and it looks kind of iridescent the pump at the top is very easy to use to just use two pumps on your face but I find that out too much just because I have oily skin. I usually use one or maybe have a bump after you shoot it out against your skin it dewy finish I find out the best way to use this is mixing half a pump of it in your moisturizer
