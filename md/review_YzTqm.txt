review reviews Invisible Shield by Glossier: this is the glossy a invisible shield SPF of 35 but you do only get one ounce for around $30 so this is pretty expensive stuff but it's really good so I'll show you why well the reason I love you so much is because it's like copay it's not it doesn't leave a white cast so people would really any skin tone can use it and if you see how clear it is it does come out in small amounts but that's okay you can just add more and there's no white cast it goes really smooth feels really smooth doesn't smell too overpowering of sunblock and it just works really well send it if there's any dupes please tell me because this is really expensive
