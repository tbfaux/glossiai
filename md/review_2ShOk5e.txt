katieee reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey guys so today I'm talking about the glossier cloud paint in the shade beam so I really love this I don't think I've liked testing it out yet on here or like done a very good review after I like actually use it for a while so I've had it for about 2 weeks now or so give or take and I absolutely love it so I already am like ready to like buy some more I have some on my Christmas list more than like shaved I love this and I love all their shade because honestly like they're so easy in like if you don't even like know what shade you should get like they all kind of work on everybody and they're so pretty like I really didn't know but I love the shade being like it looks so pretty on I have someone now I just put it on my cheeks and then a little of my nose and I think it's so pretty so I definitely recommend it you can build it up really easy or you can just keep it as a light like watercolor so definitely test it out
