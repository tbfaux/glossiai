lonnekemckinney reviews Lidstar by Glossier: hello I'm going to be reviewing the glossier lidstar in the shade called I also have the shades Moon and fun and this is probably my second favorite on being my first it is a coppery rose gold color with rose gold glitter inside I really like the formula of this one as I feel like it is one of their thicker ones as I feel moon is very thin a little bit goes a long way I only used one little dollop of this on each eye is super glittery and you can get two of these in whatever shape you want for $30 which is a very good deal if you ask me but yeah I really like this link the comments for temperature
