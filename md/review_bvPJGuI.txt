JayciNicole reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hey I got to glossy Cloud paints that I want to show you guys this one is in Dawn I'll do this one first it's the most pretty orange color you would think with it being this orange. It would look like not natural but it does hey so there's that I put on a little too much normally I just won with my fingers I did have to go in with my beauty blender but it still worked out which is the most beautiful like sunset orange and I have to say earlier I was showing my mom and I saw it on her hand and it lasted all day so I was like yesterday not earlier but yeah so this lasts a really long time which I love cuz I feel like most washes do not and yeah it's absolutely my favorite blush and I love blush
