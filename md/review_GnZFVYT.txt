carsonmakeup reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: hey guys so it's a babies cloth CA of bomb.com I have the cookie butter 1 and I had a birthday cake won and lost it but I got this one just yesterday t.j. Maxx so I'm going to test it and see how I like it the reason why these have been at t.j. Maxx is because their packaging kind of sucks and so they were getting you back to him and I am excited about but I had to grab one when I text when I saw it TJ Maxx and I would like the mint taste like a mint chip ice cream is my favorite so yeah it's really nice and doesn't taste like toothpaste or anything like that but I love his lip balms he lost a really long time and the packaging is just so cute I believe their new hatchings going to look and I'm getting example literally couldn't find example that I owned so it's like a squeezy tube but minus the tube just pull it apart is AppleCare
