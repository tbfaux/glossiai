Kittykat reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: I'm going to be reviewing the glossier balm.com in Rose and I've had this for a while now and I absolutely love it my lips get really dry throughout the entire year doesn't matter what season it is and has completely solve that forever and doesn't really have too much of a smell and it's the very thick consistency and it's kind of has this little pinkish tint to it but that doesn't really show up on the lips cuz it's really a natural tent or put it on
