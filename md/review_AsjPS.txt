jacicouture reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey bud so today I'm reviewing the coffee Express concealer this is Angie. Then it's medium coverage it's very doing and hydrating I like to use it with a small fluffy brush like this just planned it out but you can apply with your fingers and letting it out or with a beauty sponge whatever I don't recommend it for oily skin people but I like a very to we look so I love it and I also don't like a lot of coverage so you want my skin to show through the makeup so I think it's really greathe does Kris on me a lot but everything freezes on me so I too said it but I know people that don't so that's up to you I guess
