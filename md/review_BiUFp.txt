kateglavan reviews Glitter Gel√©e by Glossier: next up I have the glitter jelly from the new glossy play lines so glossy play came out or glossy I came out second line come play and it's a lot of fun glittery more I guess colorful party makeup and I'm a very minimalist person I don't wear a lot of makeup so I find the application of the new products really really helpful for me because I don't even own like an eyeshadow palette so this is the clear jelly I will show you a little bit of water looks on the inside and how to apply it so this is the glitter and it's a super chunky glitter reminds me of the early 2000s Vibes and then this is the brush that comes with an angled brush it has a little classy play on it and I find it as such a fun way to the side like a little spice to your look I totally recommend this line for anyone that is like a very much I make up a newbie or you going to make up Pro and you just looking for some fun makeup so I'm glittery makeup to a you're already amazing like line of products you
