ninii reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: everyone's so today I just want to come on here real quick to talk about the glossier Super bounce Serum with hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 I have been using this for about like 2 weeks and I really like it I've noticed that it has helped with my overall dryness on my face make it is made me feel a lot more on Westlake winter tight dry like you know when you open your mouth and you feel that kind of tight dryness so is help with that and also just feels really Cooling and soothing I like to put it on at night before like my moisturizer or before my face oil it's really nice I really recommend it for you guys I think it's one of the best one out of all of their serums so if you are going to get one of the glasses Sam's I do recommend this one especially if you have dry tight winter skin
