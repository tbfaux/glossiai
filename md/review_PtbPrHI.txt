fourteencarrot reviews Lash Slick by Glossier: I finished another one that says glossier's lash slick it is the lengthening fiber mascara and man I've probably gone through 10 tubes of this it's my favorite mascara I like the brush it is that pointy little and makes it really easy to get in here and Define all of those little hairs and then I take it like this and brush it in I wiggle it and pull it out so I will use this as my first mascara and if I would like a less natural look more dramatic I'll go on with the volume Isaac mascara and fill it out but I think this is a great mascara especially on its own for data date where it's great for no makeup look so I've already recorded the new one and so is definitely one of my Holy Grail
