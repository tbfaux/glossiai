nikkimalia reviews Super Pure by Glossier: glossier super pure face serum so I am almost all out of this one here and I restocked on the newer one it is one fluid ounce instead of .5 I believe there is no difference in the formula itself I initially bought the serum to help calm my hormonal breakouts it also helps a lot with redness I get a lot of red patches here in here so if something went wrong with my phone for a second but I already applied the serum I don't want to waste any more drops because this thing is so dear to me I just put five drops on my face directly and then I rub it in it absorbs really nicely and it leaves my skin silky smooth sometimes I forget that I need to apply moisturizer and eye cream but yeah this small bottle lasted me about six months so imagine what this bottle can do
