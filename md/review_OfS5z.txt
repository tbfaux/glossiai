tialaurynn reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: dossier priming moisturizer just by looking at my package and you can tell that I use this product a lot I really like this because you can use it either I just under your makeup to prime your face or you can use it as a moisturizer for on-the-go if you want that natural look and I can't really dry in certain spots of my face and so I really like to use this because it doesn't even break me out like a lot of others too so I just got out of the shower and what I like to do after its put it on my face because I ran my water really hot so I'll just take some like that looks like a lot but it's really not specially if you have a lot of faith areas and you could rub it in like that's what I do is focus normally in this area right here and then right here because that's where I get a lot of my dry spots and it really feels like it's moisturizing your skin cells and it really does help wrap my face everyday and I kind of just go out with my skin like this
