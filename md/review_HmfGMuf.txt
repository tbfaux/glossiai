harmonym reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: hi guys so this is called Chic slime and it is a lip and cheek tint with plant collagen now I don't know about the plant collagen but I do know that the packaging is really cute this is a reward that I receive from Super gray a while back and I just wanted to talk about it and kind of compared a little bit to the glossier cloud paint and how they kind of differ so it does come with a decent amount of product and I would say it'll last you a long time because the tiniest little bit will literally go the longest way so as you can see it's a very pretty orange in color and just a tiny little bit got me this really pigmented amount and so it kind of does get that kind of stain defect and if you if you kind of Blended out more you can get even more surface area from it for reference I believe it's the same price as a cloud paint however this has like one and a half the amount of ounces or milliliters that a cloud paint us to this is more of a bang for your buck and I would say this is a lot more pigmented use it a lot more sparingly
