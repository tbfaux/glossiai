zameena reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: so this is the glossier Milky jelly cleanser I've been using this is one of the first products I've ever got from glossy back in 2016 I think and it is a conditioning face wash and like no other I swear to goodness I know that the Bliss line carries a very similar product even looks really similar and supposed to have the same texture but apparently it's not as gentle as this one is it has a very early a really light Rose to smell to it and it does a good job at removing makeup at a surface level so you might need to go a few times with this or makeup remover to get your makeup off but does an amazing job under your skin and helping your skin feel soft and clean so I love the stuff
