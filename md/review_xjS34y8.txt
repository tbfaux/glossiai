fourteencarrot reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: here is the new glossy a priming moisturizer balance this is the oil control part of their line so they have priming moisturizer rich and the regular and this is the kind of gel cream so it comes with this great pump which I love super sanitary and I've been pumping out you can see the texture it is much lighter than there are other formulas I have kind of dry skin but I've been using thisduring the day because I was noticing that under my mask my sunscreen I use the glow screen from supergroup my skin was just too much moisture on it so I've been using us and I think it's great especially for like a summer daytime moisturizer especially if you're putting kind of Dewey moisturizing products on top I really like so I would highly recommend
