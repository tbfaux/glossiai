cherryredblossom reviews Super Glow by Glossier: hi everyone so I went to my local t.j. Maxx and I found glossy a this is the super glow there vitamin C and magnesium serum and I am just shocked I was able to find it I know there has been rumors that it has been in certain stores so let's open it up I been very curious and how to use products work because they've been up seen in social media and stuff like that so this is how the bottle looks like the little modeling for you and then this is a p serum itself I already have other vitamin C's open so I'm not going to be using this yet so when I do have a run out this is going to be my go-to I'm excited to see how well this works out on my skin and has a Milky kind of to it but then no fragrance so super excited
