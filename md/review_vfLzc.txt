amudaus reviews Priming Moisturizer by Glossier: what's up guys says hey I'm going to reviewing glossier priming moisturizer and the rich version so this is the packaging really like the packaging it's just it seems like the product is really small and there's a lot of Packaging so this is the moisturizer I really like the rich version I've tried the regular version and I have really dry skin so the the regular parking moisturizer is enough for me so I definitely prefer the rich over the regular one I really like this moisturizer really moisturize my skin and not makes it dry throughout the day the only downside for me is to send it smells like lavender and I don't really like lavender but that's it I really like this product besides that
