nicolemonaco reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so this is the bomb.com bielawski are in Rose I love so much stuff about this the stent it's definitely smells like roses it's really nice it's really settle down it goes on like most lip balms do is definitely really hydrating and it stays on for a while. Very nice glossy look to your face so I'm going to put some on all right so I have it on now this is what it looks like in the sun is very shinyI'm super excited I got this last year I use this every day if I'm not using their lip gloss I'm always using one of the two I would highly suggest getting one of these especially in the winter it's keep my lips from being chapped all winter long so definitely love this
