skincarehoney reviews Zit Stick by Glossier: so this is The Classy agents that can you probably seen it everywhere by now but I just quickly want to go over what it is and what my thoughts are so it has an antimicrobial rollerball application so anyone who's worried about hygiene with this roller ball doesn't have to worry and not only that but the benzoyl peroxide in this will also help kill bacteria also contain salicylic acid and tea tree oil but the type of salicylic acid in this is a salicylic acid Ester that actually helps improve the appearance of dry flaky irritated skin so it's not going to dry out your skin or irritated and I think it's gentle enough that you can even use it on sensitive skin as long as you do not use any other acne treatments with it it should be used on its own as a stand-alone product
