sevillathalia reviews Generation G by Glossier: so this is degeneration G lipsticks from glasses I love these lipsticks they're very sheer and their buildable this is in the shade cake it's a light peach color it looks very dark on the packaging but it's very like so I'm going to put it on as you can see it looks very natural is a very pretty color the only downside of this lipsticks is that they're kind of drying they have a light roast and you can really build up the color to look darker and overall I really like this lipstick stir perfect for everyday
