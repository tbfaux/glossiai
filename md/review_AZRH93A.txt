jannakrystal reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: so today I have with me be glossy a lip gloss this is their holographic version and I really like this product it last a long time on your lips it's also really compact so you can take it anywhere it's ready for on the go so on camera you can't really see the holographic kind of effect but it's really nice and it retails for like $16 I think it's not that bad but it could be a little bit better I know that elf has a holographic version as well and it's only like $2 but I really do recommend this it last a long time on your lips it does go away if you do eat or drink anything but it's normal for lip gloss and yeah I really recommend this I've never heard anyone say anything bad
