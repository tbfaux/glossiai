harmonym reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: DIY velcro Katrina and I'm just adding to this community review to talk about what brand I think personally has the best packaging and that would be boss yet are we surprised no because one of the main things a glossy is known for is their packaging however I just would like to say that I think that in most cases while their packaging is very cute I also find it to be very functional like for the milky oil I do enjoy the white squeezy tube that is in a way where has like the find dropper for the Milky jelly cleanser I do enjoy the pump so although we give lost a lot of credit for having really cute packaging also they have barely functional packaging as well including their zip stick I like the tip of hit it is how it has like a cooling effect and a rollerball so yeah overall good packaging
