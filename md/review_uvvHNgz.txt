melissarosee reviews Glossier Milk Jelly Cleanser Travel size/Mini 2oz by Glossier: hey buddy today many varying the Milky jelly from glossy so if I'm going to be honest with you guys. It's not really the best cleanser cuz like it basically feels like you're just watering like putting water on your face and even after you put it on I mean it feels like your skin is a bit more moisturized but it does not feel like it got a good cleanse so I give it ran a 5 out of 10 also, if you want to do vuse reviews because I don't really have too much coins so
