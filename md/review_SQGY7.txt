thekristynedit reviews Lidstar by Glossier: so guys this is the glossier lidstar in the shade moon this is definitely not my favorite product from glossy as you can see with one small layer of this it's very patchy not very pigmented this is with another layer and as you can see it is still very very patchy and still super sheer so yeah this definitely is not one of my favorite products from glassy but I'll show you how it looks if you put it in your inner corner that's what it looks like a purse has nothing it is pretty but it's super drying and just super patchy like it's really unimpressive and I don't know maybe I need to try other Shades but this is definitely not worth the price you can get amazing liquid eyeshadows from steel or just a different brand other than VI Sol pass for this one
