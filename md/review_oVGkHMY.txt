lilyjordan reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: the guy said 7 to be reading some bomb.com from glass yet so I think these retail for $12 a piece but my favorite one is the birthday because it's super pretty color in the sun is so good and my second favorite is probably this one because it's such a subtle hint of pink this is the Rose one and I send my least favorite is mango it does have a pretty orange pink that's pretty but the scent is a bit strong they all pretty much have the same texture but sometimes they seem like they separate overtime the oils so I just like giving it a quick mix and I'll show you how I apply the road I love these cuz they're so clean and smooth no Madonna quite as much but that is my final review on glossier Balm.com
