bbygurlvane reviews Milky Oil by Glossier: I'm going to be showing you how easily the glossy milky oil removes makeup even waterproof I'm actually also wearing the new glossy Glitters on my eyes and I soaked this cotton pad this is after just a little bit I'm going to let it soak I was really wearing a lot of mascara but there you can see it it's really gentle and really does a good job of taking away the only thing is I you might have to use a lot of Cotton Patch so I personally use an oil cleanser and I feel like that's more convenient but in terms of an eye makeup remover I think this is great
