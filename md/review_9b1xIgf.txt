mariahrnorth reviews Balm Dotcom by Glossier: so I am so late to the game on owning a bomb.com I just got this today it's the coconut one I bought it honestly because of the like aesthetica of it I love little peachy orange colors coconut flavor is like amazing so I have it on right now I love it like I know what everybody's talking about when they rant and Rave about it I'm just so glad actually how about it kind of tastes and smells like toasted coconut almost I was I was expecting something a little more beachy and tropical but it's it's a really warm toasted coconut scent and flavor I guess but I really love it so coconut is translucent Universal skin Salve however I'll probably stick to just using but I really really love it
