fourteencarrot reviews Solution by Glossier: given that I am just finishing my second bottle of solution I thought now would be a great time to review so for me this is a great example of how you may not have a good impression of products right after you test I actually had a terrible breakout after using the glossy solution for about a week and I attributed to the product and I stopped using it however I ran out of another exfoliant and so I just tried this again and it has lived up to the hype for me I wouldn't say I have acne prone skin but I'm definitely prone to breakouts especially down around my chin and you're in my forehead and this has helped a lot to control that and I think also Swept Away dead skin I really dry skin so it tends to flake on me so they just have a blood that the AHA BHA PHA and I love the pump people you just press down a couple times
