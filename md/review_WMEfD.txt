holakata reviews Brow Flick by Glossier: okay so brow flick for thicker eyebrows or more Fuller eyebrows like mine I recommend getting if you have little patches like this as you can see the point is very fine so this is really good because I put it on my hand it's really sure and not too heavyso it's good for think it's best for smaller eyebrows if you want to make them a little bit more mold or you want to fill in your patches put a clear brow gel over it and it's lovely
