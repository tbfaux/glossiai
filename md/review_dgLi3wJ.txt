helenemmert reviews Solution by Glossier: so this is the clausius solution and I just got this today and I actually didn't know that this was an acne treatment so I read the back and there's actually a lot of warnings which really scare me so there's actually a few things I love and hate about the solution I really like the applicator this pomp it's special to different I've never seen anything like this I like the packaging it's really cute but I don't like the smell of this you can smell chemicals I don't know it's probably one of these things the chemical solution smells really bad and sometimes I my skin it burns and the warnings on the back really scare me because it's telling me till I avoid my eyes and everything and sometimes it burns my face which is a little scary so I'm not sure about this product but I thought it was important to note that it's an acne treatment and not really good for dry skin
