mollia716 reviews Boy Brow by Glossier: this is glossier boy brow food packaging on this is really nice this is what the brush looks like this is what my eyebrows look like right now and then I'll show you what they look like with a boy brow this is what they look like with the boy brow and I really love this I use this probably every day and it just keeps my eyebrows in place and it doesn't feel like sticky or like it's too gets too hard so they still say like pretty malleable so this is $16 and I think it's worth it because I've tried another brow gel from Elf kind of like flaked off and it was cheap but you get what you pay for so I would give us five out of five stars
