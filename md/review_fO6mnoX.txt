butterandbeauty reviews Cloud Paint by Glossier: all right and we are Capron things off by the way if you wash all of these I'm extremely impressed thank you is my favorite it's very it's kind of a simple Brown I like the mixing just with almost all of them I think it's kind of just grounds it so say you're doing what's up more Berry color this allows it to become something more of like a tri-color or an eye color I'm going to put on the 2nd but yeah this is the one just to show you for a reference this is the one I carry around cuz it's beat up cuz I using so much all right hang on because it actually works a bunch of ways I put it on this side I think it's just like a little bit of warm hang onand here I can actually for me at least it works it's kind of a little bit of a contour if I put it there and kind of push up and then melted into whatever which I think is pretty cool last one and lastly I have a very simple eye color which I love
