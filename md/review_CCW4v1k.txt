Alyssakeval reviews Lip Gloss by Glossier: can I see you today I'm going to be reviewing the glossy lip gloss it's in shape clear transparent this is what it looks like it is one of my favorite lip glosses and I really recommend it it's not sticky at all and it just gives a nice glossy finish applicator is probably the best part it bends while you're applying it so it just gives a nice application feel there's a dreamer Shades just this one is my favorite pie
