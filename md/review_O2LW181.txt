milamenges reviews Super Bounce by Glossier: hey guys this is be glossy I super balance High hyaluronic acid plus vitamin B5 serum this is kind of like this one I think they're like I don't know I know they go together in a set that you can get from class today and that's what I did with this but this is literally my favorite out of those two it hydrate my skin so much since I've pretty dry skin and I'm pretty sure hyaluronic acid is supposed to hydrate your skin but it does that and again it helps make my skin just super glowy in I think it helped my skin overall a lot
