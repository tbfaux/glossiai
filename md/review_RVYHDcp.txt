amywhitehouse reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hey guys so just getting ready and next step is concealer I'm using the glossy a stretch concealer in G 11 and it's the second lightest shade they offer us a really nice neutral faircolor so let's take a look hey go so it's a light to medium coverage concealer but I really like that during the day again it's allows my skin to show through just a bit so it looks more natural it doesn't settle into fine lines as much as other concealers do and can cover kind of healing blemishes where the skin gets a little bit dry
