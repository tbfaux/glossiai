butterandbeauty reviews Hand Cream by Glossier: so this is the glossy a hand lotion there's not much to explain about him lotion the name pretty much says it but I really like this one it came out last year sorry I'm almost finished with this I have to wrap it a little bit but I really like it because it's very it is a really good for traveling you know it stays on its not going to leak it doesn't put on it doesn't dispense too much at once which you know who wants to waste hand cream it smells so very similar to their fragrance let's hear you and I really like that it's hydrating but it doesn't leave a residue like this absorbs very quickly for 18 bucks like it doesn't come fully for which maybe that's just so that it doesn't leak I'm not sure but I do think it's a really nice dupe for a lot of like more upscale or expensive
