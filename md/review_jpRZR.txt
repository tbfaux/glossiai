mikayla_rose_lynn reviews Stretch Concealer by Glossier: hello so today I'm going to be trying the glossy a stretch concealer I have it in the shade G11 I believe it is the second lightest shade on glasses website I was tempted to go a shade lighter and I'm honestly glad I didn't usually my trouble with concealer oh my gosh just covering up my dark circles is that I end up going to light and then I find that in photos there's a lot of flashback with it so it does cover up dark circles really well I have a lot of blue color on the inner corner of my eye I apologize I'm super congested right now so and then here I have some acne scarring and if I just passed that on it completely goes away so highly recommend amazing concealer
