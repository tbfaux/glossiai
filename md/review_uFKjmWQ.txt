jalynv reviews Cotton Rounds by Glossier: smoothies with a glossy cotton rounds in the packaging tonight and is literally so cute but I think it'll excessive but it's totally fine cuz you can definitely be used as I don't know how are cotton rounds if you want I guess but I just think the packaging so cute and so on and so on brand can you come to send you another pack but cries because you looking as they are and they're like $4 and I'm received a little imprinted G4 Los Gary there I thought they would be softer but they're actually not that stuff they feel like they're nothing special and yeah there cuz I think you pay for packaging really because he's a really really cute but they are $4 I don't know if I'd buy them again there's like any other
