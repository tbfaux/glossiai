ivanalagos reviews Liquid Eyeliner by Glossier: pink eye so I think I was talking about the little Shaker ball that it has inside at screen how many Islanders have that so he can just see no shake it and I'll return to spends more product than the other thing is that the stuff does not fade it does not transfer it does not disappear in the middle of the day does not give you like you know those Panda eyes like I seriously put it on my top inner corner and it's an even transferred to my bottom inner corner like it just dries super quickly that is one thing though it dries very fast and once it's on it's on so make sure that you work quickly I guess or you're going to have to practice a little bit if you're not that good at it but I mean the snow will need liquid eyeliner that I'm going to buy for the rest of my life is to see amazing the only thing is that it's brand new so I'm afraid it's one of those products that it just like perfect and then it lasts like a week and then it dries that would be heartbreaking but for now I love this 10 points you need it
