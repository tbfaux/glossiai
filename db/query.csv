Why it's special:

We wanted skin to look like it was actually kissed by the sun: each shade has a touch of luminosity from light-reflecting pearls and a thoughtful balance of warmth and dimension (so your bronzer looks just as natural in broad daylight as it does in your bathroom mirror)

The almost-whipped gel crème is infused with Desert Milk™ (a micro-emulsion of plant oils and extracts like Jojoba and Aloe) to condition and nourish, and has a natural-effect finish that blends seamlessly with the heat of your fingers

We added a doe foot to ensure your bronzer ends up in all the places the sun would naturally hit (a little goes a long way with this formula, so you’ll want to start with a few dots, blend it out, and you can always build it up from there)

We community tested our shades until we landed on ones that were flattering and true to life—each tint was formulated with different color pearls and pigments to realistically capture how the sun warms each range of skin tones

Is just so cute but the formula itself I'm so picky about who I love that you can open it one-handed to and like the formula is just so thin and light that honestly like it's perfect like it's absorbed so nicely I personally don't like that greasy oily feeling that a lot of Hank Williams leave behind I hate that I normally when I put body lotion like wash my hands cuz I hate that feeling but this just absorb so nice. Definitely believes your hands feeling so soft and hydrated and it also leaves a little bit of a glow I don't know if you can really tell but I really love this I know this is random in my brother was washing his hands so much they were getting like dry crusty and they were also starting to like bleed I know it's a lot but I told him you need to stop doing that because it's terrible switch up yourself and you"

So what I would do is I put a bit on the side of it on this side and then I would use the applicator to spread it out on my eyelid pretty much like all the way you can blend it up pretty well and then I would just blend edges at the end with my fingersthe color that I got is just like a light wash of pink you can see it here I really like it"

I like to dab just right in the corner and then just blend out with your ring finger grapes I would highly recommend these days I think they're fun there's a good range of everyday and more fun colors"

It's very lightweight it has no color in it is very clear and I can apply chili well especially over by moisturizer also something that I recently learned is that you when you apply Vitamin C and sunscreen it actually makes the sunscreen work better so and you should always apply sunscreen if you're using vitamin C and things like that that can attract the sun in damage your skin further so just in tips but I really enjoy this one I'm outside a bunch of other sunscreen even work as well for me so highly recommend"
